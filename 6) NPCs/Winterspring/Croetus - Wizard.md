The Wizard of Wellspring is an accomplished hedge mage and well versed in matters concerning spells and magical creatures. He lives in the Low District, in a round house with a conical roof.

Occupation and History: Croetus came to Wellspring five years ago after fleeing a southern city for a scandalous tryst with a merchant prince’s wife. He has kept a low profile in the town ever since, watchful for assassins he’s sure lurk behind every shadow.

Physical Description: Croetus is a tall, thin human male with short salt-and-pepper hair and a long mustache drooping down either side of his mouth. He has big eyes and a hawkish nose. Always fashionable, he wears a black silk shirt and matching breeches held up by a wide leather belt with a silver clasp. Croetus twirls his mustache when thoughtful or nervous.

Values and Motivations: Croetus is a shameless flirt and lecher. He dotes on ladies of any race or age. In spite of this failing, he is good at what he does. Croetus is more inclined to help any group that has one or more female members.
