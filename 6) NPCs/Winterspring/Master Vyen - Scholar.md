Master Vyen knows a great deal about Wellspring’s history. He lives in a stone house in the High District, where he tutors highborn children, teaching them to read and write.

Occupation and History: Vyen is the fourth son of a minor noble in a city far to the east. Given up to the Church of Ioun to become a priest, Vyen served there for a time. When he turned eighteen, he quit the monastery and headed west, settling in Wellspring. A true scholar, he turned his keen mind to unearthing the secrets of this strange little town and its environs.

Physical Description: Vyen is fast approaching his fiftieth year. His hair has gone to white, and wrinkles cover his face. His watery-green eyes seem tired, but he can affect a smile when need be. He’s most often found wearing comfortable brown robes and surrounded by his books. Master Vyen steeples his fingers when he talks.

Values and Motivations: If Vyen took one thing with him from his time as an acolyte, it was a thirst for knowledge. He cherishes his books and his learning, and he tries to impart the same zeal, with mixed results, to his students. He is friendly and helpful, reserving special kindness for other scholars.
