Present at the trading post when the heroes arrive is a half-orc scavenger named Fulgrim. Fulgrim deals in the pelts of exotic creatures that live in the Chaos Scar. He waits until others, usually adventurers, have slain a number of dangerous creatures and then comes in behind them to claim their pelts and skins for himself. Many of these pelts are considered to be valuable commodities by traders. For example, one year, owlbear-skin cloaks were all the rage among nobles of a nearby city, and Fulgrim was only too happy to provide pelts to traders who came to the Crossroads.
