One of the only people that can claim to be a real resident of the Crossroads is a Tiefling man called Millen Silvereye. According to local rumor, Millen was permanently scarred by a run-in with a mind flayer. The encounter turned one of Millen’s eyes to solid silver and gave him amazing prescience, allowing him to see into the future a short distance. 

The truth, while far less exciting, isn’t that different. Millen, a modestly talented wielder of psionic power, has cultivated his skills and can see beyond the immediate future. He uses this power to predict what the value of an item might be, looking into its future to see its ultimate destiny, acting as an appraiser for goods brought to the Crossroads for trade. In exchange for a small cut of each transaction, Millen serves as a neutral arbiter of value whom both traders and the inhabitants of the valley have come to trust. His silver eye is merely a replacement he had crafted after the eye was cut out by an orc chieftain who was unhappy with the value he gave an item.
