## DM Notes
The corporal of the guard.  Over 40 years old, he has seen a number of battles and considers his post here something of a retirement.  Grouchy and pushy, he'd rather be sitting and relaxing than dealing with visitors, but he has a soft spot for a pretty face or a tough, battle-scarred veteran.  If he takes a liking to a newcomer, he gives them directions around the keep and might even take a particularly lovely visitor for a tour.  Otherwise, he tries to get visitors out of his hair as quickly as possible.
