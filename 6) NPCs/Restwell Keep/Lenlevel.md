## History
TBD

## DM Notes
The farmer, Lenlevel, owns a small plot of land just northeast of Restwell Keep.Â  He's married to Wara and has four children. The PCs met Lenlevel investigating the bullywug attacks from the adventure Stick in the Mud.

Winter has befriended Lenlevel and routinely checks in on him and his family.  He even brough gooseberries from along the Kings Wall to the farm and planted them so Lenlevel wouldn't need to go harvest them.
