Charming, with a moon face, twinkling eyes, and a round belly which cast him as a mirthful friar.  He plays up this act with perfect charm, using humor and self-deprecation to win his way into the trust of others.  The folk think he is a priest of Tymora wandering the land in search of new experiences.  In truth, he is an adept of Malar who seeks to overthrow the keep and claim it as a fortress dedicated to a snake cult branch of Malar's faith.
