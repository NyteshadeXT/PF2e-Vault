Mother Aran runs a tight ship.  Her secret family recipes for both food and drink have kept residents and visitors to the keep well fed for many years.  Generous and friendly, she sees herself as a grandmother to all who come into her tavern.  She serves to keep the folk of the keep unified, despite their differences.  She sees no evil in tent in Lord Drysdale's actions and is one of his biggest supporters in the outer baily.
