![[Garrick Blackoak.png]]

Garrick is a tough veteran of many battles against evil.  He is absolutely loyal to Lord Drysdale.  His temper, however, has proven his undoing.  He has a miserable reputation among the people of the keep due to several brawls started by overhearing insults against Lord Drysdale.  He usually questions those who seek entrance to the inner bailey.  Rude and easily angered, he rarely allows quick or direct access.  At best, Garrick might dispatch a messenger to Lord Drysdale to set up a meeting at a later date.
