### Plot Hooks
Involved in several plot hooks with Ailwin arrested.  See [[Restwell Jobs]]  under the Saruun Guildhall entry.

### Hidden Details
The scars on his face were caused during a battle with undead sent by a rival necromancer to kill him.  His family was killed during the attack and his home destroyed.  He remains a shell of his former self and is currently without purpose in his life.

### General Notes
Balewin steps in to run the Saruun Guildhall after Ailwin is arrested.
