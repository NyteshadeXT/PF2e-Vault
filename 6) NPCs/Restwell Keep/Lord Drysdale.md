## DM Notes
In his old age, Drysdale has decided to settle down while continuing to do what good he can.  He sees the keep as a seed that, with the right attention, can bloom into a gleaming bastion of civilization.  He dreams of amassing enough warriors to draw settlers and merchants to the region.  In time, he hopes to defeat the evil of the Chaos Scar and turn the entire region into a civilized realm.  While an excellent warrior and skilled tactician, he has little experience as a politician.  The concerns and worries of the folk of the outer bailey strike him as mere complains.  He would remove them from the keep and relocate them to safer lands if he could and does not understand why they would want to dwell in the shadow of the Chaos Scar.  He keeps a keen eye out for promising adventurers.  As part of his long term strategy for reclaiming the region, he wants information on the Chaos Scar.  Adventurers that defeat evil creatures within the Scar earn his respect.  If such adventures prove themselves over time, he eventually invites them into the fortress for a banquet.
