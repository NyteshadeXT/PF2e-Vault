## DM Notes
Zeta is rescued by the players during the adventure Some Assembly Required.  She is a fearless young girl who Mordak is has befriended and would like to turn into a warrior.  She finds Cassendra's magic very interesting and likes to pretend that she is interested in learning it to tease Mordak.

### Plot Hooks
TBD

### Hidden Details

**Zeta as a Chaos Remnant**
Zeta's body contains residual Chaos energy that acts as a beacon, attracting creatures or followers of Kataklysmos. This could create a sense of urgency for the party to find a permanent solution to her condition. They may need to seek out powerful artifacts or allies to cleanse her completely.

She also discovers she has developed strange new abilities. These powers might be unpredictable and dangerous, requiring the party to help her learn control while keeping her from harm. 

Kataklysmos has not given up on his prize yet, however. Angered by the party's interference he sends agents to recapture Zeta. 


#### Chaotic Powers

1. **Chaos Surge**
   - **Effect:** Once per day, Zeta can unleash a surge of chaotic energy. This could manifest as a burst of magical damage (such as Force or a random energy type) to all creatures within a 10-foot radius.
   - **Mechanics:** Zeta can use a 3-action activity to release a Chaos Surge. Each creature in the area must make a Reflex save (DC = Zeta's class DC or spell DC). On a failure, they take 2d6 damage of a random energy type (roll 1d6: 1 = Acid, 2 = Cold, 3 = Electricity, 4 = Fire, 5 = Sonic, 6 = Force). On a success, they take half damage.

2. **Unstable Form**
   - **Effect:** Zeta's body momentarily shifts in and out of reality, granting her increased defenses and a chance to avoid attacks.
   - **Mechanics:** Zeta gains the ability to use a reaction once per day to gain concealment (20% miss chance) against an attack that would otherwise hit her. This lasts until the end of her next turn.

3. **Chaotic Healing**
   - **Effect:** Zeta can tap into the chaos within to rapidly heal her wounds or those of her allies, though the effects are unpredictable.
   - **Mechanics:** As a 2-action activity, Zeta can heal herself or an ally within 30 feet for 3d8 Hit Points. Roll a d20 after the healing is applied: on a 1, the target takes 1d8 damage instead as chaotic energy backfires.

#### Psychic or Mystic Powers

4. **Mind Touch**
   - **Effect:** Zeta can reach into the minds of others, communicating telepathically or sensing their surface thoughts.
   - **Mechanics:** Zeta gains the ability to cast **Detect Thoughts** as an innate spell once per day. Additionally, she can telepathically communicate with any creature within 30 feet that she can see.

5. **Dreamwalker**
   - **Effect:** Zeta's experiences while comatose have granted her insight into the dream realm. She can influence dreams and gather information from them.
   - **Mechanics:** Zeta can cast **Dream Message** as an innate spell once per day. Additionally, she gains a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to interpret dreams or receive visions.

#### Protective Powers

6. **Chaos Shield**
   - **Effect:** A swirling shield of chaotic energy protects Zeta, reducing damage from attacks.
   - **Mechanics:** Zeta gains the ability to cast **Shield** as an innate cantrip at will. Additionally, once per day, she can use a 1-action activity to gain resistance 5 to all damage types for 1 minute.

7. **Fate's Intervention**
   - **Effect:** Tymora's influence manifests, allowing Zeta to alter fate in small ways.
   - **Mechanics:** Once per day, Zeta can use a reaction to force an enemy to reroll an attack roll, skill check, or saving throw. The enemy must take the second result, even if it's worse.

#### Utility Powers

8. **Chaotic Adaptation**
   - **Effect:** Zeta's body can adapt to different environments and conditions.
   - **Mechanics:** Zeta gains the ability to cast **Endure Elements** and **Water Breathing** as innate spells once per day each. Additionally, she can change her appearance slightly (such as skin color, hair color, etc.) at will as a 2-action activity.

9. **Planar Connection**
   - **Effect:** Zeta's connection to Chaos allows her to interact with planar energies and entities.
   - **Mechanics:** Zeta gains the ability to cast **Summon Construct** as an innate spell once per day, summoning a minor chaotic creature to assist her. She can also attempt to communicate with extraplanar entities with a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks.

10. **Warp Reality**
    - **Effect:** Zeta can briefly warp reality around her, creating illusions or altering the environment.
    - **Mechanics:** Zeta gains the ability to cast **Illusory Disguise** and **Illusory Object** as innate spells once per day each.
