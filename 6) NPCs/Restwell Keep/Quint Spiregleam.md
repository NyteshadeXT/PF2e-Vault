## DM Notes
A young gnome, Quint is eager to buy up jewels and art objects recovered by adventurers and sell them to collectors in the larger towns.  He aggressively approaches adventurers new to the keep in hopes of buying such items from them.  He can be a handy source of adventures, as he regularly sends messages to and from the more civilized lands.
