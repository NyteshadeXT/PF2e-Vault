## History
TBD

## DM Notes
At a young age, he received a strange blessing from Oghma.  He has perfect recall of everything he sees and hears, but will lose this gift if he ever speaks a word.  Instead, he commits to history of Restwell Keep, as he witnesses it, to his book.  He loves to hear stories of distant places.  His quiet, unassuming nature causes other folk to underestimate him, and he keeps his gift of memory a secret.  Strangers to the keep tend to think of him as deaf and dumb, and he has overheard many interesting stories not meant for his ears.

### General Notes
This male human wears typical workman's clothes and carries a battered leather book he uses to record visitors' names and any weapons left with Fallek.  He wears a holy symbol of Oghma on a silver chain, but usually conceals it beneath his shirt.
