![[Peer and Pout Revet.png]]

The shrine of Oghma is run by two aged human brothers named Peer and Poul Revet. Identical twins, the two are hard to tell apart. Both have shaggy gray hair tucked under scriber’s caps; they wear the same color, style, and cut of robes; and they speak in the same low grumble. The only obvious difference between them is in the style of the handlebar mustaches that both affect: Peer wears his curled upward, while Poul’s curls down.
