The dwarf, Gorn Hammerfall,  was elevated to the captain's post for his skill in siegecraft and engineering.  He is responsible for maintaining the catapults and ballistae that protect the keep.  In his free time, he works to restore the keep's original stonework and fortify its already formidable defenses.  Gorn has recently come into some money, although almost no one is aware of where or how.  He wears a jeweled ring and loves to gamble at the Stumbling Giant.
