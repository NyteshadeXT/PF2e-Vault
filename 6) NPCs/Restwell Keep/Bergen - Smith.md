This slender, slight male human looks more like a scholar than a smith.  A devotee of Moradin, he relies on his knowledge of metals rather than brute strength.  He particularly loves a challenge, and he has a great knowledge of dwarven rituals and lore.  If given the correct materials he can make many magical weapons and armor.
