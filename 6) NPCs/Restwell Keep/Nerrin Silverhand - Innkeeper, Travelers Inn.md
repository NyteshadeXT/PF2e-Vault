![[Nerrin Silverhand.png]]

A human, Nerrin is cheap, greedy and easily angered.  He has a bad reputation for allowing the fires in the inn to die down before midnight, leaving guests to resort to their own gear to remain warm.  He guards the stock of firewood like a snarling dragon, but will gladly add a log to the fire if paid a few silver.
