Order's Covenant once belonged to a champion of Moradin,  Ivak Stoneblood.  Ivak made it his life's work to bring order to a chaotic world.  He defended many a dwarven stronghold from demonic invaders.  Upon Ivak's death the warhammer was interred with him and has lain dormant since.

The hammer’s head is shaped like an anvil and the steel gleams with a bluish tint. Order's Covenant is a +1 [Striking](../striking.md) warhammer.
