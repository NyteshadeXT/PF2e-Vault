# Bludgeoning Arrow *Item 0*  

**Bulk:** L (Light)  
**Range Increment:** 60 feet  
**Traits:** Ammunition, Bludgeoning

**Special:**
- **Critical Specialization Effect:** On a critical hit, the target is knocked prone.

These arrows have rounded wooden tips designed to deal bludgeoning damage rather than piercing. They are perfect for situations where you want to subdue rather than kill your target. When using bludgeoning arrows, you can deal nonlethal damage without the usual -2 penalty for using a lethal weapon to deal nonlethal damage.

> [!pf2-note]
> Different weapons have different prices for ammunition. The prices listed are thus, only for reference in the weapon statblocks themselves.
