**Effect** Vines from the spear attemp to burrow into a the wound created by the spear and begin to pulse as if feeding.  The next creature successfully wounded by the spear may have the corrupting influnce of the Choas Shards forcably withdrawn from its body into the spear.  The target makes a Will save versus the class or spell DC of Tempered Harmony's owner.  Can have unexpected side effects...
