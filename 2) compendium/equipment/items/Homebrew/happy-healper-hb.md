- **Price** 95 gp
- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Activate** [Command](rules/actions/command.md)

When the sick wards are packed, healpers are deployed. These temporarily-sentient constructs act as an extra pair of hands for an overwhelmed healer, administering aid and stabilizing those on the brink of death.

As an action while you hold the healper, you can speak the command phrase “Healp! Healp!” followed by a short instruction (see below). The bundle of alchemical paraphernalia springs into life for the next minute. It is a tiny construct with AC 13, 10 hit points, a walking speed of 30 feet, a Strength of 3, immunity to poison and psychic damage, immunity to all conditions except grappled and restrained, and it can't attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, it destroyed and can’t be used again. It has 3 charges.  Once expended the healper no longer functions.

The healper has one action per round and takes its turn immediately after the creature who summoned it. The summoner, as an action, can give it one of the following instructions:

- 0 charges: [[stabilize]] [[heal]]
- 1 charge: [[heal]] 2nd-level, [[restoration]] , [[restore-senses|Restore Senses]] 
- 2 charges: [[heal]] 3rd-level, [[remove-disease|Remove Disease]]
