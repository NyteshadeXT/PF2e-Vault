# Glowmetal Weapon *Item 12+*  
[uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Bulk** varies by weapon; **Usage** varies by weapon

Glowmetal weapons have a slightly purple sheen to them when under direct sunlight.

Glowmetal is makes the weapon it coats magical with a +1 potency.  However, this magic comes with a price, it is tainted by the influence of the meteorite. The first time in any encounter where the wielder uses the glowmetal weapon as part of an attack, he or she must make a DC 15 Fortitude save. If the save fails, the wielder gains an unsightly disfigurement. If the check fails by 5 or more, the wielder’s mind is strained by the weird emanations of the glowmetal. He or she takes a permanent –1 penalty to Will saves; this penalty is cumulative with each such failure. 

A single [[spells-dataview-backup/spells/level-4/remove-curse|Remove Curse]] spell removes all disfigurements and penalties.
