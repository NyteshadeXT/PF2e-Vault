Vandals, scholars, and explorers alike appreciate the magical longevity of this short stick of red chalk.  This chalk never breaks or wears down with normal use.  Any writing or drawing made with this chalk cannot be erased for one week by anyone except the original artist or author.

If the eternal chalk is used to draw anything inside the maic circle in the inner sanctum, a portal opens to Voran's Study in his ruined keep.  The portal lasts until the wielder takes a long rest.
