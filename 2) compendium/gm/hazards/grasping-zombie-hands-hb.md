# Grasping Zombie Hands *Hazard 2*  
[haunt](rules/traits/haunt.md)

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** No check necessary to notice the bodies in the cages

These cages hang like fruit from a large metal tree. Inside, rotting corpses—some fresher than others—lean against the bars of the cages.  Animated by undeath they reach out to grab the living.

- **Disable** DC 18 [Survival](../../skills.md#Survival) (trained) to avoid the grasping hands or DC 21 [Religion](../../skills.md#Religion) (trained) to suppress the negative energies suffusing the bodies.  
     
```ad-embed-ability
title: Grabbed [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Grabbed ")

- **Trigger**: A creature approaches the cages.

**Effect** The bodies inside the cages reachout to grasp and hold the target [Grab](../../../Conditions.md#Grabbed).
```

**Reset** The bodies settle down after no creatures have been in the area for 1 minute.
