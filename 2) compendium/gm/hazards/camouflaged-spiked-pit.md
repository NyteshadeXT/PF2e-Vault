# Camouflaged Spiked Pit *Hazard 8*  
[mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 31 (expert)   

A 20-foot deep, funnel-shaped pit with dozens of wooden spikes lining it's walls.

- **Disable** Taking the covering away is a simple way to expose the danger to allow someone to merely avoid it by walking around its edges, but it cannot be quickly disabled.

[attack](rules/traits/attack.md "Attack Combat Trait")  

- **Trigger**: A creature walks onto the pit.

**Effect** The triggering creature falls and rolls through several spikes as it slides to the bottom.  This inflicts 5 bludgeoning damage from the fall itself down the steep slope (the falling PC can't attept to [[grab-an-edge]] due to the lack of defined edges to the pit's walls), but the falling PC must also attempt a DC 26 Reflex save.

> - **Success** The character takes 2d10+11 piercing damage from the spikes.
> - **Failure** The character takes 4d10+22 piercing damage from the spikes.
> - **Critical Failure** The caracter takes 4d10+22 piercing damage from the spikes plus `2d6` [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).  While the character is taking this bleed damage they are also sickened 2 from the pain.
```

**Reset** Creatures can still fall into the trap once it has been exposed, but the camouflaged cover must be reset manually for the trap to become hidden again.
