# Boiling Oil Chute *Hazard 4*  
[environmental](rules/traits/environmental.md "Environmental Hazard Trait")  [fire](rules/traits/fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait") [mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 22 trained  

When triggered boiling oil is released from the chute above scalding anyone caught in the area.

- **Disable** DC 25 [Thievery](../../../skills.md#Thievery) to jam the pressure plates which trigger the chute
- **Reset** A creature near the upper apparatus can take a standard action to reset the trap. If the trap has attacked and been reset already, then attacks again, it must be refilled which takes 1 minute.

- **Trigger**: A creature steps on the pressure plate space.

**Effect** The boiling oil is dropped, dealing `4d8+10` fire damage to all creatures and objects in area (DC 21 basic Reflex save).
