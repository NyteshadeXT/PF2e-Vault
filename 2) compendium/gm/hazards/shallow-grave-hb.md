# Cracked Earth *Hazard 3*  
[environmental](../../../rules/traits/environmental.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 22 trained  

The land is dotted with shallow pits, just deep enough to keep the rain from washing away the dirt covering fresh corpses inside. Shallow graves throughout the area quickly fill with a layer of foul-smelling dirt when anyone falls inside, making it hard to get out or make attacks.

- **Disable** DC 16 [Athletics](../../skills.md#Athletics) (untrained) A creature restrained by a shallow grave can spend a move action to try and escape. With a success, the creature is no longer restrained by the shallow grave.
     
```ad-embed-ability
title: Pulled In [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature ends its movement or ends its turn adjacent to a shallow grave.

	**Effect** The target is pulled into the shallow grave and [restrained] (../../rules/conditions.md#Restrained). The target does not get to save against being pulled over the precipice into the shallow grave.
