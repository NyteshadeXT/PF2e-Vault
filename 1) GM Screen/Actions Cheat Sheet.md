| [aid](aid.md) *⬲{ .Pathfinder }*                       | Must have used an action previously to help your ally. When an ally makes a skill check, you assist them, granting them a +1 circumstance bonus to their check. If you’re a master with the check you attempted, the bonus is +3, and if you’re legendary, it’s +4 Crit. Fail: -1 circumstance penalty to their check. Must pass a check set by the GM, Base DC 20.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |     |
| [crawl](crawl.md) *⬻{ .Pathfinder }*                   | **[move](move.md)** While you are [conditions](conditions.md#Prone), you are unable to [stride](stride.md) or [step](step.md). Instead, you [crawl](crawl.md) 5ft (if speed is more than 5ft).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |     |
| [delay](delay.md) *⭓{ .Pathfinder }*                   | At the start of your turn, after suffering [chapter-9-playing-the-game](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Persistent%20Damage) and ending any effects that should end, you can decide to [delay](delay.md) your turn until later in the round. You can re-enter the initiative order at the end of any other creature’s turn, permanently establishing your initiative at that point in the round.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |     |
| [drop-prone](drop-prone.md) *⬻{ .Pathfinder }*         | **[move](move.md)** You fall [conditions](conditions.md#Prone). You are [conditions](conditions.md#Flat-Footed) (-2 circumstance penalty to AC) and take a –2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls. The only move actions you can take while prone are [crawl](crawl.md) and [stand](stand.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |     |
| [escape](escape.md) *⬻{ .Pathfinder }*                 | **[attack](attack.md)** You attempt to escape from being [conditions](conditions.md#Grabbed), [conditions](conditions.md#Immobilized), or [conditions](conditions.md#Restrained) against one impediment. Attempt a acrobatics, athletics or unarmed attack check vs. DC of the effect (Athletics of creature grabbing, Thievery of creature that tied you up, Spell effect or [escape](escape.md) DC). Crit: You are free and can stride 5ft. Crit. Fail: You don’t get free, and you can’t attempt again until next turn.                                                                                                                 |     |
| [interact](interact.md) *⬻{ .Pathfinder }*             | **[manipulate](manipulate.md)** You can [grab](grab.md) an unattended or stored object, open a door, etc.. You might have to attempt a skill check to determine if successful. This action generally provokes reactions such as [attack-of-opportunity](3)%20Rules/actions/attack-of-opportunity.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |     |
| [leap](leap.md) *⬻{ .Pathfinder }*                     | **[move](move.md)** You [leap](leap.md) up to 10ft horizontally (Speed is at least 15ft), or up to 15ft horizontally (Speed is at least 30ft.) You land in the space where [leap](leap.md) ends. Leap Vertically moves 3ft. Vertically and 5ft. Horizontally. The Athletics skill offers [long-jump](long-jump.md) and [high-jump](high-jump.md) activities, which each cost 2 actions and can be taken by any creature, and allow you to move a greater distance based on how high your check result is. (p. 241)                                                                                               |     |
| [ready](ready.md) *⬺{ .Pathfinder }*                   | **[concentrate](concentrate.md)** Choose an action you can perform and a trigger for that action. If the trigger occurs before the start of your next turn, you can use the chosen action as a reaction (provided you still meet the requirements to use it). If you [ready](ready.md) an attack, and that attack would have a multiple attack penalty if it were made on your turn, the penalty still applies during your reaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |     |
| [release](release.md) *⭓{ .Pathfinder }*               | **[manipulate](manipulate.md)** You release something you’re holding in your hand(s). Does not trigger reactions that can be triggered by actions with the [manipulate](manipulate.md) trait. If you want to Release something outside of turn, use [ready](ready.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |     |
| [seek](seek.md) *⬻{ .Pathfinder }*                     | **[concentrate](concentrate.md) [secret](secret.md)** You look for unseen creatures or objects in a 30ft cone or 15ft burst within line of sight. If searching for objects (secret doors, hazards), you [search](search.md) a 10-foot square adjacent to you. The GM makes a secret [Perception](../../rules/compendium/skills.md#Perception) check vs. Stealth DCs of hidden creatures or objects in that area. Success: One or more hidden creatures’ or objects’ position is revealed. Otherwise, the GM will not specify.                             |     |
| [sense-motive](sense-motive.md) *⬻{ .Pathfinder }*     | **[concentrate](concentrate.md) [secret](secret.md)** Choose one creature.The GM makes secret [Perception](../../rules/compendium/skills.md#Perception) check vs. Deception DC. Crit: You determine creature’s true intentions and any [mental](mental.md) magic affecting it. Success: You determine whether it is behaving normally, but not its exact intentions or magic affecting it. Fail: You detect what it wants you to believe or think they’re behaving normally. Crit. Fail. You get a false sense of its intentions. You typically can’t try again until the situation changes significantly. |     |
| [stand](stand.md) *⬻{ .Pathfinder }*                   | **[move](move.md)** You [stand](stand.md) up from [conditions](conditions.md#Prone).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |     |

Move 5ft without provoking reactions that trigger as a result of your moving or leaving or entering a square. You can’t [step](step.md) into [chapter-9-playing-the-game](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Difficult%20Terrain) without Feather Step.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |     |
