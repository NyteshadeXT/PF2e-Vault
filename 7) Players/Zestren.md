Zestren is a graceful elven warrior dressed in traveler’s clothing and chainmail covered by a long, blue-gray cloak. He carries a longsword in a scabbard hanging from his leather belt. He says little and appears to disdain humans.

Zestren is new to the keep, having been around only for a few days. He keeps to himself and says little to anyone. He perks up when anyone mentions Magrak Ironjaw, however.. Some say he’s the only survivor of an adventuring group that met their match in a dungeon near Winterspring.
