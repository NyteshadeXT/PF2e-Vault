[[Cluff Maclire.webp|Show to Players]]

Cluff Maclire is a middle-aged, lanky, pale human warrior with stringy brown hair going to gray. He wears a tartan kilt and a leather jack studded with metal spikes. He carries a bastard sword in a sheath hanging down the middle of his back. He is a plain-spoken man with little patience for nonsense and no tolerance for cowardice. He has vowed to kill Magrak Ironjaw and save his people even if it costs his own life.

Cluff is a loudmouth and braggart, he talks big but no one around here has ever heard of him before. The Maclire clansmen are fringe-dwellers, having little to do with civilized folks.
