# Heal *Spell 1*   
[healing](rules/traits/healing.md "Healing Effect Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [positive](rules/traits/positive.md "Positive Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Traditions** [divine](rules/traits/Divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait"), [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast**  `pf2:1` to  `pf2:3`
- **Range**: varies
- **Targets**: 1 willing living creature or 1 undead

You channel vital energy to heal the living or damage the undead. If the target is a willing living creature, you restore 1d8 Hit Points. If the target is undead, you deal that amount of vitality damage to it, and it gets a basic Fortitude save. The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines its targets, range, area, and other parameters.

 `pf2:1` **(somatic)** The spell has a range of touch.  
 `pf2:2` **(somatic, verbal)** The spell has a range of 30 feet. If you're healing a living creature, increase the Hit Points restored by 8.  
 `pf2:3` **(material, somatic, verbal)** You disperse positive energy in a 30-foot emanation. This targets all living and undead creatures in the burst.

***
**Heightened (+1)** The amount of healing or damage increases by 1d8, and the extra healing for the 2-action version increases by 8.
