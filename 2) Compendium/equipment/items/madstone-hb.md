# Madstone *Item 6*  
[cursed](rules/traits/cursed-gmg.md "Cursed Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  

- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand

This dully glowing lump of metal has a strange, oily texture. It heals wounds but leaves a strange lassitude.

You can use the Madstone to restore 3d8+10 hit points and like an [[elixir-of-life|Elixir of Life]], to gain a +2 to saving throws against diseases and poisons for 10 minutes.

Whenever you activate the Madstone you suffer ([[conditions#clumsy|Clumsy]]) 2 until you take an 8 hour rest.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") command

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** The madstone heals the activating character for 3d8+10 hit points and applies a +2 bonus to saving throws against diseases and poisons for the next 10 minutes. It leaves the character feeling strangely lethargic, however, and the activating character then suffers ([[conditions#clumsy|Clumsy]]) 2 until an 8 hour rest is taken.
