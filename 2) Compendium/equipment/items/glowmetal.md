# Glowmetal *Item 8+*  
[precious](rules/traits/precious.md "Precious Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

Glowmetal is only found in the Chaos Scar.  A glowmetal item is often made of a different material and then coted in glowmetal.  It is metal that has been corrupted by the influence of the Chaos Shard meteorite.  It can imbue a weapon with magical properties, but looses it's effectiveness 24 hours after leaving the Chaos Scar becoming an imbalanced and unwieldly item.  It also can be disruptive to the wielder causing disfigurement which requires a [[spells-dataview-backup/spells/level-4/remove-curse|Remove Curse]] spell to correct.
