# Shield Gauntlet *Item 0*  
[finesse](finesse.md)

- **Group** Shield 

This gauntlet is finely crafted from thin steel plates that uniquely cover both the inside and outside of the hand. This careful construction allows for relatively fine control with the gauntleted hand, but also grants full protection for grabbing an enemy weapon by the dangerous end. You can wield weapons and carry objects in the hand that is wearing the shield gauntlet, but you aren't considered to be wielding it while you do so, nor can you Raise a Shield or use any Shield Reactions until the hand is once again free.
