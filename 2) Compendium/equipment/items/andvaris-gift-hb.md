# Andvari's Gift *Item 8+*

- **Bulk** —; **Usage** worn

This golden ring is inscribed with runes symbolizing wealth and prosperity, and seems to glow slightly with tiny golden motes of light. Legends say the ring is cursed to bring misfortune and destruction to whoever bears it. While wearing this ring you are able to passively identify the amount and purity of gold in any item, and can gain the benefit of Andvari's Gift at will.

**Golden Curse:** If Andvari’s Gift is used more than two times in the span of one day, you become invested in it. While invested, you suffer a -5 penalty on charisma and wisdom saving throws and skill checks. If you attempt to discard the ring while you are affected by the item's curse it will return to you in a mysterious way, such as appearing in a pouch, coin purse, or pocket. Attunement to the ring cannot be ended voluntarily unless you relinquish the ring to an recipient that is unsuspecting of the curse, but is capable of speaking the command word. Upon relinquishing the ring to another person, you can never regain it through any means and events will conspire to keep it from you.

- **Frequency**: once per minute

**Effect** You can speak the command word to form a trail of softly glowing golden dust leading from you to the nearest source of gold that is at least 5 gp in value, and that is not currently worn or held by a creature. The trail extends out to 100 feet as you follow it, curving around obstacles and corners where possible. If all paths to the detected gold source are blocked (such as being hidden behind a door or stored in a safe), the trail will end as close to it as possible until whatever obstacle preventing passage is removed or overcome. The effect ends immediately if the detected gold source is physically destroyed, transported to another plane, or picked up by any creature.
