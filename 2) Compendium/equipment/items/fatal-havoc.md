Fatal Havoc is a powerful but unpredictable weapon.  Once wielded by the Githyanki champion Lykus the two cut a swath of chaos and death in their wake.  Stories say in a pitched battled against a gold dragon Fatal Havoc turned on Lykus when he was at his weakest.  Fatal Havoc has since passed hands many times since with most owners not truly understanding the weapon they held.  It was believed to have been lost some where in astral space, and has not been heard from in an age.

The weapons pommel is crafted in the shape of a skull apparently from some kind of bone. Fatal Havoc is a +1 [Striking](compendium/equipment/items/striking.md) rapier.

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** Fatal Havoc absorbs ambient chaotic energy when within the Chaos Scar.  As it charges, swirling wisps form around the blade.  They darken to a purple color becoming more dense and agitated the longer this ability remains unused.  Once per day, the wielder of Fatal Havoc, upon a successful strike which causes the target damage, may expel the chaotic energy into the target through the wound.  The target becomes instantly infused with Chaos.  Can have unexpected effects.
