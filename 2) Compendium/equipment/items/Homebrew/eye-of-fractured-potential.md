This jagged monocle is formed from one of the tyrantâ€™s preserved crystalline eye stalks. The gem pulses with chaotic insight and unpredictable clarity.  Upon investing and wearing it you gain a +2 item bonus to [[skills#Perception|Perceptoin]] checks and Will saves against illusions or mind-affecting effects.  

You are permanently affected by _true seeing_ on your dominant eye, but you gain vulnerable 5 to visual sensory overload effects (e.g., _color spray_, _prismatic spray_).
