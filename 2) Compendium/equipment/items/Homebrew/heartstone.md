- **Activate** `pf2:1` command

This small dense stone is wrapped in wire. When activated, it spreads across the face of your shield and up the arm that wields it, protecting it and its wearer for as long as the stone holds up against attack. Your shield gains `dice: 5d6 + 10` temporary Hit Points and you gain half that amount.
