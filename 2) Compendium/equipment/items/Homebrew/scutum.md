An ancient style of shield, but still effective, the scutum is large and rectangular, with a convex shape to help deflect incoming blows rather than absorb them into the shield. It is primarily made of wood and typically reinforced with metal bands. Famously used in shield formations, this shield is no less effective when used alone.

*The extra circumstance bonus on the scutum only applies when the character uses the Take Cover action while the shield is raised.
