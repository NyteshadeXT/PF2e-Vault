# Mask of the Porcelain Pretender
*Item 14 • Rare • Illusion, Divination, Invested*

![[mask-of-the-porcelain-pretender.webp|right]]

This porcelain mask bears a fixed, mischievous grin that seems to shift subtly in the corner of your eye. When you speak while wearing it, your voice carries an unnatural precision and warmth, capable of perfectly mimicking others you've heard.

---

### **Effects**
While invested and worn, you can perfectly mimic the voice, tone, and mannerisms of any creature whose voice you have heard speaking in conversation. This grants you a +2 item bonus to [[skills#Deception|Deception]] checks to [[impersonate|Impersonate]] when using a voice you have heard.

You can speak telepathically across any distance as if casting [[Sending]], using the mask as the focus. The message can appear to come from another creature whose voice and likeness you know well. The recipient perceives the message as genuine if they are familiar with the impersonated creature.

A recipient can attempt a Will save against your spell DC (DC 32, or your own spell DC if higher) to sense something unnatural if they have reason to doubt the message. On a success, they recognize faint magical interference in the communication.  

You can cast *sending* through the mask up to three times per day, and the mask automatically heightens the spell to 7th rank. If you can already cast *sending*, you may channel it through the mask to gain its disguise effects.

> [!info]- Note
> ### **Curse of the Widening Smile**
> Each time you use the mask to deceive another creature with *sending* or to speak in another’s voice for malicious ends, the mask’s grin widens ever so slightly.  After enough deceptions (GM’s discretion, typically 10 or more), the mask subtly influences your speech—compelling you to lie or manipulate others without conscious thought.  If worn for more than a week while so cursed, you must succeed at a Will save (DC 33) each dawn or become Tempted until the next day.
> 
> While you are _Tempted_, you suffer subtle magical influence urging you toward deceit, manipulation, or indulgence — usually in line with the source of temptation (such as the Mask’s compulsion to deceive).  **Effect** You take a –2 status penalty to Perception checks, Sense Motive checks, and Will saves made to resist deception, charm, or emotion effects.  When making Deception checks, you must attempt a DC 5 flat check. On a failure, the magic subtly distorts your words or tone to make your statement sound misleading, even if you’re telling the truth.  Each day you use deceit or impersonation to manipulate others, the DC to resist increases by 1 (to a maximum of +5). Each day you resist its influence by acting truthfully and abstaining from deception, you can attempt a Will save (DC 33) to end the condition.
> 
> Removing or breaking the mask halts the curse but leaves faint porcelain cracks along your own smile for several days.
