[consumable](consumable.md)  [magical](magical.md)  [talisman](talisman.md)  [conjuration](conjuration.md)

- **Price** 90 gp
- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** affixed to a shield
- **Activate** `pf2:1` command

A small piece of a brick with surrounding mortar that is wrapped in gold wire. When activated, you create a brick wall 3 feet tall, 1 foot thick, and 15 feet wide. The wall must be adjacent to you and centered on your square.

The wall is difficult terrain for creatures moving through it, and it provides standard cover to anyone in its area or adjacent to it. It can potentially provide cover for creatures further away at the GM's discretion.
