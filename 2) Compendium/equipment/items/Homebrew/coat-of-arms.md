# Coat of Arms *Item 3*  
[uncommon](uncommon.md) [adjustment](adjustment-lotgb.md)  [visual](visual.md)

- **Price** 20 gp
- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** applied to shield

Stitched onto a leather face, painted, or lacquered on, a coat of arms can mean a great deal depending on whom you're addressing. It can lend weight to your words, the deals you make, and even the insults you throw. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[skills#Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] checks while you are wielding the shield, as long as the coat of arms represents a faction that would be feared or respected by the target of the check, at the GM's discretion.
