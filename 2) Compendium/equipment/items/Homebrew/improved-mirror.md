A mirror that is custom-fitted for your shield. You gain access to the following reaction. If you use the Shield Block reaction, or gain the benefits of the Shield Block reaction with this shield in response to a critical hit from an attack, this  adjustment is broken and you cannot benefit from it until it has been repaired as part of a successful [[repair]] action on the shield.

**Activate** `pf2:r` envision; **Frequency** once per minute; **Trigger** You are targeted by an effect with the visual trait; **Effect** You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your AC or saving throw against the triggering effect. Regardless of whether you are affected by the triggering effect, you may attempt to redirect the effect at a target within 30 feet. If the effect requires a saving throw, the target must attempt the same saving throw. If it requires an attack roll, attempt a shield attack roll to determine whether it hits.
