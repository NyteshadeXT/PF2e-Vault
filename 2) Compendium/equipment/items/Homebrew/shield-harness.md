# Shield Harness *Item 7*  
[adjustment](adjustment-lotgb.md)  

- **Price** 105 gp
- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** applied to a medium or heavy shield

Your shield has been modified so that you can harness it firmly to your back when you are not actively wielding it. When you are wearing your shield instead of wielding it, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC against attacks made against you if you are considered flat-footed against the attack because you are flanked by another enemy. If you are hit by such an attack, you take the damage as normal. The shield also takes the damage but reduces it by its Hardness. If the shield is broken or destroyed, you no longer receive this benefit.
