The Scarblade, a +2 Keen Flaming Striking weapon, is a dark, rugged weapon forged from a chaos shard torn from the Chaos Scar itself. Every successful strike with the sword emits red sparks and causes the blade to leave a charred mark across whatever it cuts. Even magically healed wounds carry faint ashen scarring.  

Upon first being grasped, it instinctively reshapes into the favored weapon type of its wielder (typically a martial weapon such as a longsword, greataxe, or glaive), retaining its damage die and traits where possible. It is intelligent and relishes the thrill of battle, pushing its wielder toward acts of personal glory.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Glory's Edge**

- **Trigger** You first take possession of the Scarblade
- **Effect** The weapon instantly transforms into your preferred melee weapon (chosen by your highest weapon proficiency with a martial weapon). It retains all magical properties and adjusts its traits accordingly.
```


```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate - Chaosflame (Magical, Fire)**

- **Frequency**: once per turn

**Effect** Once per turn, when you hit with an attack using Scarblade, the target takes 1d6 persistent fire damage. If you're within the **Chaos Scar**, this increases to 1d10 persistent fire damage instead. The fire is chaotic and unnatural—healing magic leaves ragged black scars across the wounds. This fire cannot be extinguished except through magical healing, dousing with holy water, or a successful DC 25 flat check.
```


```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activated Ability – Rift Strike (Evocation, Fire, Chaotic)** `pf2:2` [[Interact]]

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Requirements**: You wield Scarblade in two hands.

**Effect**: You slam Scarblade into the ground, unleashing a chaotic shockwave. A crevasse rips open in a **30-foot line** (6 squares), 5 feet wide and 10 feet deep, beginning in your square and extending in a straight line. Creatures fully in the area must attempt a DC 31 **Reflex save**.  Those who fail suffer 4d6 bludgeoning damage, are **knocked prone** and fall in; those critically fail suffer 6d6 bludgeoning damage and are **restrained** in rubble until they Escape (DC 28 Athletics or Acrobatics). 

The crevasse is difficult terrain and remains until refilled or magically sealed. Within the Chaos Scar, the crevasse also emits flickering red flame; creatures within or adjacent to the crevasse take 1d6 fire damage at the end of each of their turns.
