This dark and rugged bastard sword is forged from a jagged chaos shard, its surface flickering with crimson motes of fire and instability. The blade leaves behind blackened scorch marks and searing ashen scars when it strikes, resonating with chaotic power—especially within the Chaos Scar, where its energies grow wild and dangerous.  The Scarblade is a +2 Striking Bastard Sword. Every successful strike with the sword emits red sparks and causes the blade to leave a charred mark across whatever it cuts. Even magically healed wounds carry faint ashen scarring. On a critical hit, Scarblade deals an extra 2d6 fire damage, or 3d6 fire damage within the Chaos Scar.

### Scarblade (Weapon, Bastard Sword +2 Striking)

**Chaotic Wounds** *(Magical, Fire)*  
Once per turn, when you hit with an attack using Scarblade, the target takes **1d6 persistent fire damage**. If you're within the **Chaos Scar**, this increases to **1d10 persistent fire damage** instead. The fire is chaotic and unnatural—healing magic leaves ragged black scars across the wounds. This fire cannot be extinguished except through magical healing, dousing with holy water, or a successful DC 25 flat check.

### **Activated Ability – Rift Strike ⚡ (Evocation, Fire, Chaotic)**
**Frequency**: Once per day  
**Action**: 2 actions (✦✦)  
**Requirements**: You wield Scarblade in two hands.

**Effect**: You slam Scarblade into the ground, unleashing a chaotic shockwave. A crevasse rips open in a **30-foot line** (6 squares), 5 feet wide and 10 feet deep, beginning in your square and extending in a straight line. Creatures fully in the area must attempt a **Reflex save**:

- **DC 31**  
- **Critical Success**: The creature leaps clear and is unaffected.  
- **Success**: The creature jumps back or forward, avoiding the crevasse.  
- **Failure**: The creature falls into the crevasse and takes **4d6 bludgeoning damage** from the fall.  
- **Critical Failure**: The creature falls and lands prone, taking **6d6 bludgeoning damage** and becoming **off-guard** until the end of its next turn.

The crevasse is difficult terrain and remains for 1 minute or until magically repaired. Within the **Chaos Scar**, the crevasse also emits flickering red flame; creatures within or adjacent to the crevasse take **1d6 fire damage** at the end of each of their turns.
