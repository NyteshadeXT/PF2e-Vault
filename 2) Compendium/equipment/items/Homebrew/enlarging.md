# Enlarging *Item 7*  
[magical](magical.md)  [transmutation](transmutation.md)  

- **Price** 325 gp
- **Usage** etched onto a shield

This rune pattern etched around the edge of your shield gives it the ability to grow on command.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** `pf2:2` command; **Frequency** once per minute; 

**Effect** The shield gains the [[cumbersome]] trait and provides cover to other creatures until the end of your next turn. You [[raise-a-shield|Raise a Shield]] and command it to become larger. You may choose to spend an action to Take Cover while this effect is active to increase the circumstance bonus to AC from raising your shield by +2. On subsequent turns you may sustain this effect by spending an action to [[raise-a-shield|Raise a Shield]] again. You can Dismiss this effect as a free action with the [[concentrate]] trait.
```
