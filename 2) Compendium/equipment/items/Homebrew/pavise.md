This enormous rectangular metal shield can be used to protect the wielder's entire body, and is often used as a source of cover for allied archers, wielded both for the defense of the user and for nearby allies. It is incredibly heavy and unwieldy.

*The extra circumstance bonus on the pavise only applies when the character uses the Take Cover action while the shield is raised.
