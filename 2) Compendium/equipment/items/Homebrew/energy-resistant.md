# Energy-Resistant *Item 5+*  
[magical](magical.md)  [abjuration](abjuration.md)  

- **Price** 150 gp
- **Usage** etched onto a shield

A rune symbolizing one of the primary elements protects this shield and its wearer from that element. You and the shield gain resistance 3 to acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The crafter chooses the type of damage when creating the rune. Multiple energy-resistant runes can be etched onto a shield; rather than using only the highest-level effect, each must provide resistance to a different damage type. For instance, a +2 fire-resistant cold-resistant shield would give you fire resistance 3 and cold resistance 3.
