# Hoplon *Item 0*  

- **Category** Heavy
- **Price** 10 gp
- **Bulk** 2
- **AC Bonus** +2/+2; **Hardness** 5, **HP** 24 (BT 12); **Speed Penalty** -5 ft.
- **Group** Shield 

This round metal shield affords great protection and durability. While it is the smallest of the heavy shields, its simple and durable construction makes it capable of withstanding many hits. Its smaller profile also makes it the most maneuverable of the heavy shields and unlike the other heavy shields, this prevents the use of the Take Cover action to gain an additional circumstance bonus to AC.
