# Hardened *Item 6+*  
[abjuration](abjuration.md)  [magical](magical.md)  

- **Usage** etched onto a shield

Magic wards increase the Hardness of the shield. Increase the shield's Hardness by 2 if it's a light shield, by 3 if it's a medium shield, or by 4 if it's a heavy shield.

You can upgrade the hardened rune already etched on a shield to a stronger version, increasing the values of the existing rune to those of the new rune. You must have the formula of the stronger rune to do so, and the Price of the upgrade is the difference between the runes' Prices.
