This fist-sized shard is a piece of the Eye Tyrant's warped core. Its interior refracts into impossible geometries. It feels like it's pulsing… in reverse.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Recursive Pulse **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") Interact, Manipulate

- **Frequency**: once per hour

You cast duplicative form (as [[mirror image]], but you create 1d4+1 duplicates instead of 3), and then roll a flat check (DC 11).
- **Success** The crystal stabilizes, and the spell functions normally.
- **Failure** Your form shifts violently—you instead cast [[gaseous form]] on yourself (no save, no resistance check). You remain in this form for 1d4 rounds and can't dismiss it early.
- **Critical Failure** In addition, you take `dice: 4d6` 4d6 chaotic damage and become [[conditions#Confused|Confused]] for 1 round after returning to normal.

```
