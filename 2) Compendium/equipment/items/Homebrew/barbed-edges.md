# Barbed Edges *Item 5*  
[adjustment](adjustment-lotgb.md)  

- **Price** 40 gp
- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** applied to shield

You have added barbs around the edge of your shield's face that are particularly effective when used against creatures in very tight quarters. When you use the [[escape]] action against a creature to remove the [[conditions#Grabbed|Grabbed]], [[conditions#Immobilized|Immobilized]], or [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] condition and you do not roll a critical failure on the check, you also deal `dice: 2d6` slashing damage to the creature.
