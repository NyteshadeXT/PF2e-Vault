# Jack O' Lantern Mask
*Item 14 • Rare • Necromancy, Fear, Fire, Invested*

![[jack-o-lantern-mask.webp|right]]

This grotesque mask resembles a carved pumpkin, its jagged grin glowing with emberlight. When worn, faint smoke curls from its hollow eyes and your voice echoes with otherworldly menace.

---

### **Effects**

While invested and worn, the mask’s aura of dread empowers your cruelty and manifests explosive minions from harvest fire.

- You gain a +2 item bonus to **Intimidation checks**.  If you already have a proficiency rank of **Master** or higher in Intimidation, this increases to **+3**.  
- When you **Demoralize**, creatures that critically fail their Will save are **Frightened 3** instead of **Frightened 2**.

---

### **Activation — *Harvest Terror***
- **`pf2:2`** (Concentrate, Divine, Emotion, Fear, Mental)
- **Frequency** 1/day; or 2/day by expending 2 charges (see below)
- **Effect:** You cast **[[2) Compendium/spells/fear|Fear (5th Level)]]** (DC 34 Will save). The magic takes the form of burning orange eyes and a wave of laughter echoing like crackling fire.  
  The mask recharges this ability fully at dusk.

---

### **Activation — *Summon Pumpkin Bombs***
- **`pf2:2`** (Conjuration, Fire, Magical)
- **Frequency** up to 6 charges per day
- **Effect:** Expend 1 charge to conjure a Pumpkin Bomb. These spectral pumpkins hover around you, acting on your initiative immediately after your turn.  You can have up to 4 Pumpkin Bombs active at one time.  Each lasts for up to 1 minute.  If a bomb moves more than 120 feet from you, it explodes immediately.

Each **Pumpkin Bomb** uses the following statistics:

#### **Pumpkin Bomb**
*Tiny construct (fire, magical); AC 32; Fort +25, Ref +27; HP 40; Speed fly 30 feet.*

**Strike** (1 action) — *Explode*  
**Attack:** +26 to hit  **Damage:** `dice: 4d8` fire damage on hit.  

When reduced to 0 HP, a Pumpkin Bomb explodes automatically.

---

### **Charges and Recharge**
The Jack O’ Lantern Mask holds 6 charges.  You can expend charges to use *Harvest Terror* again (2 charges) or to conjure Pumpkin Bombs (1 charge per summoning).  The mask regains all charges at dusk.

---
> [!info]- Note
> ### **Curse of the Burning Grin**
> If you go 7 days without invoking its fear or summoning abilities, the mask grows restless — at dusk on the seventh day, it casts **[[Fear (4th rank)]]** centered on you (DC 32).  Those who wear the mask for too long find the carved grin beginning to match their own.

---

### **Craft Requirements**
You can cast *fear* and *summon construct*, and your crafting must take place during a harvest moon or amid burning pumpkin fields.
