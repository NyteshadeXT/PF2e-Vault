# Aggressive *Item 6*  
[magical](magical.md)  [transmutation](transmutation.md)  

- **Usage** etched onto a shield

This rune enables the shield to attack almost entirely on its own when raised.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** `pf2:1` Interact; **Frequency** once per day; 

**Effect** Once activated the shield launches itself at enemies when you raise it. The shield becomes animated for 1 minute, during which time you can [[Strike]] with it as a free action each time you [[raise-a-shield|Raise a Shield]]. If this shield has a weapon attachment, use those statistics for [[Strike|Strikes]] made with the shield, otherwise [[Strike|Strikes]] made while this effect is active deal `dice: 2d4` bludgeoning damage on a hit.
```
