**Image:** [[Farbane.webp|Show to Players]]  
**Item Type:** Weapon (Warhammer)  
**Price:** 10,500 gp  
**Bulk:** 2  

This warhammer is forged from an uncanny violet alloy that hums faintly when held, as if resonating with distant planar vibrations. The metal’s surface ripples with shifting geometric reflections, suggesting a forging process not meant for mortal understanding. When swung, the weapon leaves behind momentary prismatic trails of light.

Farbane is a +3 greater striking brilliant aberration bane warhammer. In addition to the effects of these runes, it holds several unique properties.

---

## **Aberrant Sense**
When an aberration is within **60 feet**, Farbane emits **dim violet light** in a **10-foot emanation**.  You can suppress or resume this light as a single action (concentrate).

---

## **Psychic Ward**
While wielding Farbane, you gain **resistance 10 mental**.

> # **GM-Only: Interaction with Kassandra, the Voice of Kataklysmos**
> 
> Farbane resonates with the fractal harmonics of Kassandra’s corruption. The hammer is not *truly* designed to slay her—it is meant to **anchor her**, preventing her full rebirth as the Voice of Kataklysmos.
> 
> When a creature wielding Farbane Strikes Kassandra (or her avatars):
> 
> - The attack gains a **+2 circumstance bonus** to hit.  
> - The Strike deals **+2d6 mental damage** as Farbane destabilizes the aberrant resonance inside her.  
> - **Once per day**, if Kassandra would reduce the wielder to 0 HP, the wielder instead drops to **1 HP** as Farbane “rebounds” the killing blow into a planar distortion.
> 
> Kassandra instinctively recognizes the weapon, though she may not understand *why*.
> 
>> **Farbane cannot kill Kassandra outright.**  
>> When delivered a fatal blow, it instead forces her aberrant essence to disperse temporarily, delaying—but not preventing—her return.
> 
> This becomes relevant during the climax of your campaign’s storyline.
