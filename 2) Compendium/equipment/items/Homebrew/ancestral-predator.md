# Ancestral Predator *Item 3*  
[Uncommon](uncommon.md) [adjustment](adjustment-lotgb.md)  

- **Price** 20 gp
- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** applied to shield

Stitched onto a leather face, painted, or lacquered on, you have created an image on the face of your shield that evokes an ancient fear from a specific group. Choose a type of creature that isn't typically mindless such as aberration, animal, astral, dragon, elemental, ethereal, fey, fiend, giant, humanoid, or monitor. You etch an image of an ancient foe for that type of creature on the face of your shield, and can brandish it to make yourself more intimidating. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to all [[skills#Intimidation|Intimidation]] checks made against creatures of the chosen type while you're wielding this shield. You may choose undead as your type, but consider that many undead are mindless and immune to all mental effects, including Intimidation.
