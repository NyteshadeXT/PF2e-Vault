## **Harley’s Treat of Joy**

_Item 14 • Rare • Consumable • Elixir, Emotion, Mental, Magical_

**Usage** held in 1 hand **Bulk** L **Activate** ⟐ (Drink) **Price** 4,000 gp  
**Duration** 1 minute

This radiant cider glows with golden light and effervescent bubbles of laughter. When uncorked, it releases a sweet scent of pumpkin and caramel.

### **Effect**

Warm confidence floods your heart.

- You become **immune to the frightened condition** and immediately reduce your current frightened value to 0.
    
- You gain a **+2 status bonus** to **Will saves** against mental or emotion effects.
    
- You gain the effect of the **[[inspire-heroics|Inspire Heroics (6th rank)]]** spell. (If you’re already benefiting from _Inspire Courage_ or _Inspire Defense_, increase that bonus by 1 for 1 round instead.)
    
- For the duration of the elixir, whenever you critically succeed at a saving throw, a burst of harmless lantern-light fills a 10-foot radius around you, granting all allies within that area temporary Hit Points equal to half your level.
    

When the effect ends, the light fades gently, leaving behind faint warmth and the taste of spiced sugar on your tongue.
