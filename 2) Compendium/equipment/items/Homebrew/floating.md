# Floating *Item 12*  
 [uncommon](uncommon.md) [magical](magical.md)  [abjuration](abjuration.md) 

- **Price** 2,000 gp
- **Usage** etched onto a shield

This rune gives your shield a mind of its own.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** `pf2:1` interact; **Frequency** once per day; 

**Effect** The shield releases itself from your arm and floats next to you. You gain your shield's circumstance bonus to AC as if you had raised it, but cannot use any Shield Reactions while it is floating in this way. After 1 minute, the magic dissipates and the shield drops to the ground. You can [[Interact]] to grab the shield and Dismiss this effect at any time.
