# Targe *Item 0*

- **Group** Shield 

This small wooden shield is favored by close-quarters fighters. Most targes feature two thin wooden planks bolted together so that the grains are perpendicular to increase strength. It is light enough to wield a small weapon in the same hand that the targe is strapped to.

You can Raise a Shield with your targe while carrying an object of light bulk, or while wielding a weapon of light bulk that has the agile trait. If you make an attack with this weapon while the shield is raised, the shield is no longer raised after the attack.
