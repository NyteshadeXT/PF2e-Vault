# Shield Strap *Item 1*  
[adjustment](adjustment-lotgb.md)  

- **Price** 1 gp
- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** applied to a light or medium shield

You have attached a leather or chain strap to your shield that you can loop over your forearm or a shoulder. When you Release your shield it doesn't fall to the ground and is considered to be worn. You may draw it as normal after Releasing it. The strap has a quick release, allowing you to still use actions and reactions that require throwing your shield, such as Interrupting Shield, but reattaching the strap is a three-action activity with the manipulate trait.
