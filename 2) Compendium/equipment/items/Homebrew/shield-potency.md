# Shield Potency *Item 3+*  
[abjuration](abjuration.md)  [magical](magical.md)  

- **Usage** etched onto a shield

Magic wards increase the durability of the shield. Increase the shield's Hit Point total by multiplying the base Hit Points of the shield by 3. The shield can be etched with one property rune.

You can upgrade the shield potency rune already etched on a shield to a stronger version, increasing the values of the existing rune to those of the new rune. You must have the formula of the stronger rune to do so, and the Price of the upgrade is the difference between the runes' Prices.
