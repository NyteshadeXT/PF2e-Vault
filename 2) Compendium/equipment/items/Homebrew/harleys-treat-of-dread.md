## **Harley’s Treat of Dread**

_Item 14 • Rare • Consumable • Elixir, Fear, Fire, Magical_

**Usage** held in 1 hand **Bulk** L **Activate** ⟐ (Drink) **Price** 4,000 gp  
**Duration** 1 minute

This dark elixir churns with orange-red fire and smoke that curls into grinning faces before fading away.

### **Effect**

You draw strength from Harley’s mischief and the thrill of terror. Your face is consumed in a mask of flickering fire.

- You gain a **+2 status bonus** to **Intimidation checks** and **attack rolls** against **frightened** creatures.
    
- When you **Demoralize**, creatures that fail their Will save become **frightened 2** (frightened 3 on a critical failure).
    
- The first time you reduce a creature to 0 HP or cause one to become frightened, a ring of spectral pumpkins bursts around you; enemies within 10 feet take **6d6 fire damage** (DC 34 basic Reflex) while allies within 10 feet instead gain **6d6 temporary Hit Points** as the harmless flames swirl protectively before fading.
    

The mask of fire flickers out at the end of the duration, leaving a faint scent of smoke and laughter.
