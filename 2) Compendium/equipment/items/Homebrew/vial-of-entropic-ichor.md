For 1 minute, you gain resistance 10 to mental and force damage and a +2 item bonus to saving throws against polymorph, fear, and confusion.

Whenever you cast a spell, you must roll `dice:1d6` 1d6:
- **1-2:** The spell is cast as normal.
- **3-4:** The spell’s target is randomly reassigned within range.
- **5:** The spell’s level is increased by 1 (up to max level you can cast).
- **6:** A random magical effect occurs (GM's choice or a roll on a chaotic surge table).

At the end of the duration, you must succeed at a DC 34 Fortitude save or become [[conditions#Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] and [[conditions#Stupefied|Stupefied 2]].
