```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") command, [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)


Once per day, you may activate this item, spreading a magical darkness that surrounds you in a 20-foot radius and lasting for up to 10 rounds.  Creatures that end their turn in range of this darkness are attacked by hooks that emerge from seemingly nowhere, forcing them to pass a DC 15 Reflex saving throw, taking `2d6` piercing damage and losing 5 feet of movement speed on failure.

Every successive turn they end in darkness will see another hook attempt to latch onto them, up to a maximum of 5.  They can attempt to remove a hook with a DC 12 Strength saving throw, adding an additional point to the difficult per each hook currently transfixing them.  If they leave the darkness without first removing the hooks they take 2 points of damage per each unresolved hook as they are ripped from their flesh.
