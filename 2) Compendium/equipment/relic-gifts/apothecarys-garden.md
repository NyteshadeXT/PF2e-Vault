# Apothecary's Garden *Minor Gift*  
[healing](rules/traits/healing.md "Healing Item Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy Item Trait")  [plant](rules/traits/plant.md "Plant Item Trait")  

**Aspect** Plant
**Effect** Your relic grows potent natural medicines. Each night, two medicinal herbs (or other plants) grow from your relic and can be harmlessly harvested during your next daily preparations. A living creature that consumes an herb with an Interact action regains `1d8` Hit Points for every 2 relic levels (minimum `1d8`). At 9th level, the relic grows three herbs each night, and at 17th level, the relic grows four herbs each night. Herbs wither away 1 day after being harvested.
