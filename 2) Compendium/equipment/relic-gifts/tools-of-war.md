# Tools of War *Minor Gift*  
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration Item Trait")  

**Aspect** Battle
**Activate** *â­“{ .Pathfinder }* command; Frequency once a day
**Trigger** You have just activated a Talisman
**Effect** Talismans are weapons of war and this relic makes them last. Activating this ability prevents the triggering Talisman from being destroyed following it's use allowing it to be used again.  No Talisman can benefit from this ability more than once and any Talisman preserved by this ability is automatically destroyed during your next daily preparations.
