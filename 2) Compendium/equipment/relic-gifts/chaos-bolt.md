# Chaos Bolt *Minor Gift*  
[chaotic](rules/traits/chaotic.md "Chaotic Item Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation Item Trait")  [force](rules/traits/force.md "Force Item Trait")

**Aspect** Chaos
**Activate** *â¬º{ .Pathfinder }* command
**Effect** You launch a bolt of chaos. A random enemy within 60 feet takes `1d4` chaotic damage and `2d4` force damage for every 2 levels this relic has (basic Reflex save). If there is only 1 enemy within range, you become a possible target. You can't use Chaos Bolt again for `1d4` rounds.
