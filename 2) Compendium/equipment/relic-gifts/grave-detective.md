# Grave Detective *Major Gift*  
[necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy Item Trait")

**Aspect** Death
**Effect** You can cast talking corpse twice a day, as an innate occult spell, at a level equal to half the relics level. Any result of a critical success by the target of the spell becomes a success instead.
