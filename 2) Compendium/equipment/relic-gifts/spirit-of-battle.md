# Spirit of Battle *Major Gift*  
[transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation Item Trait") 

**Aspect** Battle
**Prerequisite** Your relic is a weapon or armor
**Activate** *â¬²{ .Pathfinder }* command
**Frequency** once per day
**Effect** Calling upon the energies of your relic you provide a new property rune to your weapon or armor for 1 minute. If your weapon or armor is already at capacity for its runes, you may suppress a current property  rune and replace it (as long as that rune is not a prerequisite for another ability). The property rune selected must be of a level equal to or lower than the relics.
