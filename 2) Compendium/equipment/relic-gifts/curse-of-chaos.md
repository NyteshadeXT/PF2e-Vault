# Curse of Chaos *Major Gift*  
[chaotic](rules/traits/chaotic.md "Chaotic Item Trait")  [curse](rules/traits/curse.md "Curse Item Trait")  [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment Item Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Item Trait")

**Aspect** Chaos
**Activate** *â¬²{ .Pathfinder }* envision
**Frequency** once per day
**Effect** A random enemy within 30 feet must succeed a Wisdom saving throw or become stupefied 1 for 1 minute. The curse arcs to another random non-stupefied enemy within 30 feet of the first target, jumps to another non-stupefied enemy within 30 feet of that target, and so on. You must have line of effect to all targets. The chain ends if any one of the targets critically succeeds at its save or there are no more valid targets.
