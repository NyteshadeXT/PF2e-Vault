# Unpredictable Blessing *Minor Gift*  
[chaotic](rules/traits/chaotic.md "Chaotic Item Trait")  

**Aspect** Chaos
**Effect** Whenever you make your daily preparations you can roll `1d20` and refer to the chart below. You can cast the listed cantrip until your next daily preparations through your relic. The cantrip is heightened to the level of the relic. The DC for any saving throw called for by this cantrip uses the higher of your class DC or spell DC. The spell attack modifier of the cantrip is 10 lower than that DC.
