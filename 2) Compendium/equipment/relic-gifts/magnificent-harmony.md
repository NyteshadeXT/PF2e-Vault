# Magnificent Harmony *Grand Gift*  
[lawful](rules/traits/lawful.md "Lawful Item Trait")  [transumtation](rules/traits/transumtation.md "Transumtation Item Trait")  

**Aspect** Law

You gain the Assurance feat for every skill. Whenever you use the Assurance feat you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the check. This bonus applies even though you would not normally apply bonuses. Whenever you would receive healing, as a free action, you treat each dice rolled as though it rolled the highest possible result. You can't use this ability again for 10 minute.
