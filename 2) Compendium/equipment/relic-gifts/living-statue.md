# Living Statue *Grand Gift*  
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation Item Trait")  [earth](rules/traits/earth.md "Earth Item Trait")  

**Aspect** Earth
**Effect** Your relicâ€™s energies have given you control over the boundary between flesh and stone. You can cast 6th-level flesh to stone and stone to flesh as innate spells, each once per day. As long as you are standing on the earth, your body reflexively petrifies at the moment you are struck, granting you resistance 5 to physical damage (except adamantine). This increases to 8 in caves or subterranean environments.
