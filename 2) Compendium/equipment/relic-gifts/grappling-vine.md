# Grappling Vine *Major Gift*  
[plant](rules/traits/plant.md "Plant Item Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation Item Trait")  

**Aspect** Plant
**Activate** *â¬»{ .Pathfinder }* interact
**Effect** Your relic launches a sticky, multi-stranded vine at a target within 50 feet. Make an attack roll as you would when using a grappling hook, but if you roll a critical failure on the check to secure the vine, you get a failure instead. Once the vine is anchored, creatures receive a +1 status bonus to Athletics checks to Climb the vine, and they gain a +5-foot status bonus to the distance they move with a successful check while Climbing using the vine. 

The vine lasts for 1 day or until you use Grappling Vine again, at which point your older vine withers.
