# Chains of Order *Major Gift*  
[lawful](rules/traits/lawful.md "Lawful Item Trait")  [conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration Item Trait")  

**Aspect** Law
**Activate** *â¬º{ .Pathfinder }* envision
**Frequency** once per minute
**Effect** An enemy within 30 feet must succeed a Fortitude saving throw or become immobilized by magical chains for 1 minute. The chains then arc to another enemy within 30 feet of the first target, jumps to another creature within 30 feet of that target, and so on. You can't target the same creature more than once, and you must have line of effect to all targets. You can end the chain at any point. The chain ends if any one of the targets critically succeeds at its save.
