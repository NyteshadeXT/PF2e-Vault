## Chaos Shard Delirium II
**Hazard 14**  
[haunt](haunt.md), [illusion](illusion.md), [mental](mental.md), [rare](rare.md)  
**Complex, Elite**

---

**Stealth** +25 (legendary) — automatically active in terrain seeded with chaotic crystal growth  
**Description** The shard’s influence alters perception itself. Meenlocks phase in and out of awareness, becoming invisible phantasms that strike from hidden angles.

**Disable** DC 36 Arcana (to suppress the illusion field), DC 34 Nature (to collapse the crystal’s mental field), or by all PCs succeeding at **Regain Sanity**.

---

### Trigger
A meenlock within the area is targeted by an attack or harmful effect.

### Effect
As a **reaction**, the triggering meenlock becomes **invisible** until this hazard is overcome or a character successfully uses a relevant countermeasure.

This invisibility is illusory (Will DC 34 to disbelieve). A creature that disbelieves sees through the invisibility and can treat the meenlock as visible. A successful interaction or Recall Knowledge against the illusion also allows a Will save to disbelieve.

### Routine (1/minor action per round per PC)

- **Regain Sanity** (mental) — DC 35 Occultism or DC 35 Arcana  
  *Success:* The character realizes the invisibility is an illusion. All meenlocks are visible to them for the rest of the encounter.  
  *Critical Success:* As above, and they grant a +1 status bonus to all Regain Sanity checks made by allies.  
  *Failure:* The meenlocks remain invisible to that character.  
  *Critical Failure:* The character is [[flat-footed]] to all enemies for 1 round as their mind stutters.

- **Detect Enemy** (mental, concentrate) — DC 33 Perception  
  *Success:* The character can sense meenlocks adjacent to them, ignoring their invisibility until the start of their next turn.  
  *Critical Success:* Also grants a +1 status bonus to their AC against those creatures.

- **Reassure Ally** (auditory, linguistic) — DC 33 Diplomacy or Intimidation  
  *Success:* The next time an adjacent ally fails a Regain Sanity check, they may reroll it and use the better result.

### Countermeasures
Once all PCs succeed at Regain Sanity, the hazard ends and the illusory invisibility dissipates. Meenlocks become normally visible.

### GM Tips
- Use this hazard when players are already fighting meenlocks or other psychic foes—add confusion to the battlefield.
- Invisible meenlocks can flank and ambush until discovered.
- Combine with terrain like narrow tunnels or flickering lights to heighten fear and paranoia.
