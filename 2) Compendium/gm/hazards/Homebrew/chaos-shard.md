[magical](magical.md), [object](rules/traits/object.md), [illusion](illusion.md), [mental](mental.md), [psychic](rules/traits/psychic.md), [rare](rare.md)

**Stealth** — (clearly visible, floating crystalline shard)  
**Initiative** +22  
**Traits** The Chaos Shard is a glowing fractal crystal that pulses with shifting psychic energy. Often created or left behind by powerful aberrant or chaotic entities, it serves as a battlefield hazard or defensive structure.

**HP** 140 (Hardness 12)  
**AC** 35; **Fort** +30, **Ref** +18, **Will** —  
**Immunities** all conditions, [[3) Rules/traits/poison]], [[psychic]], [[mental]]  
**Weaknesses** [[force]] 10, [[sonic]] 10

### **Aura: Psychic Probe** [aura, illusion, mental, psychic] 30 feet  
Enemies within the aura have **vulnerability 10 to psychic damage**. This applies even if they would otherwise be immune, though immunities reduce damage as usual.

---

### **Controlled Alignment**  
The Chaos Shard shares the host creature’s enemies. If no host is currently attuned, it treats all creatures as enemies.

---

### **Routine**
Each round on its initiative, the shard casts **Winds of Madness**:

#### ⬻ **Winds of Madness** [one-action]  
**(illusion, mental, psychic)**  
**Area** 30-foot emanation  
**Saving Throw** DC 33 Will  
**Effect** Each enemy in the area takes 6d6+10 psychic damage (DC 33 basic Will save). On a failed save, the shard may teleport the creature up to 10 feet in any direction. This is forced movement.

---

### **Countermeasures**

- **⟳ Impede the Flow** (Arcana DC 35) [one-action, concentrate]  
  *Effect:* You temporarily disrupt the shard’s psychic matrix. It can’t use Winds of Madness on its next turn.

- **⟲ Take Control** (Arcana DC 42) [two-actions, concentrate]  
  *Effect:* You override the shard’s allegiance. Until another creature takes control, the shard treats the controlling creature’s enemies as its own.  
  *Failure:* You’re [[stunned]] 1 as feedback ravages your mind.  
  *Critical Failure:* You are stunned 2 and take 6d6 psychic damage.

- **⟲ Destroy the Shard**  
  The shard can be damaged and destroyed like other magical objects, though its [[Hardness 12]] and immunities make this difficult.

---

### **GM Tips**
- This hazard is ideal in psychic or chaos-themed encounters, especially with creatures like [[meenlocks]], [[faceless stalkers]], or Far Realm invaders.
- You can position it in the center of a battlefield to change how players cluster or avoid psychic effects.
- Consider making the shard crack and erupt violently on destruction for a last burst of psychic backlash (e.g., 6d6 psychic, DC 33 basic Will).

Let me know if you'd like to create variants for different terrain types (lava shard, ice shard, void shard) or if you want a version that drops **monster parts** or **crafting essence** on defeat!
