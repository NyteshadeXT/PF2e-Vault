# Donjon's Cave-In *Hazard 10*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md "Complex Hazard Trait")  [earth](rules/traits/earth.md "Earth Energy & Element Trait") [mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +22 (trained) — Only detectable with **Survival** or **Engineering Lore** while examining the cave structure  

A buried pressure rune beneath loose stone triggers a localized cave-in when Donjon uses a primal command or when a creature steps into a trigger zone.

- **Disable** A DC 30 [[skills#Thievery|Thievery]] check will disarm the trap if discovered beforehand.  Alternately, a DC 27 [[skills#Lore|Engineering Lore]]or a DC 28 [[skills#Survival|Survival]] will allow the player to detect structural weakness or instability and a DC 28 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check can then be used to shore up structure with support beams or braces.
- **Reset** The trap is composed of loose ceiling rock and partially reinforced columns. Once collapsed, it can’t be reset, though sections may be cleared with 10 minutes of effort and appropriate tools.

- **AC** 30, **Fort** +24, **Ref** +20
- **HP** 80 (Hardness 10)
- **Immunities** critical hits; object immunities; precision damage

title: **Cave-in Blast** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

**Trigger**: A creature enters a **marked danger zone** (10-ft square), or Donjon spends an action to command the terrain to collapse (Free Action, **once per encounter**).

**Effect** The cave-in is triggered. All creatures in the target area (10ft. burst) must make a +22 vs. Reflex save **On Hit**: The target suffers `dice: 4d8+10` bludgeoning damage and become [[conditions#Immobilized|Immobilized]] DC 30 to escape or ends at end of the targets next turn. **On Miss**: The target suffers half damage and is [[push|Pushed]] 5 feet in a direction of the trap’s choice. Regardless of result the target area becomes difficult terrain (cluttered with rubble) until cleared.
