## Chaos Shard Delirium
**Hazard 14**  
[haunt](haunt.md), [illusion](illusion.md), [mental](mental.md), [rare](rare.md)  
**Complex, Elite**

---

**Stealth** +26 (legendary) — automatically activated in affected terrain  
**Description** A radiant crystal shard from the heart of the Chaos Wastes corrupts minds with perfect phantasms. Slain enemies rise again in terrifyingly convincing illusion.

**Disable** DC 38 Arcana (to dispel the illusion), DC 36 Nature (to stabilize the chaotic energy), or by succeeding at all “Regain Sanity” checks below

---

### Trigger
A creature dies within the area of the shard’s influence.

### Reset
The hazard remains active until all affected PCs succeed at Regain Sanity checks or are incapacitated.

---

### Effect
At the start of the next round after a creature dies, an **Illusory Revenant** rises (use the stats of a level 10 elite creature appropriate to the setting, such as an **Elite Troglodyte Veteran**, **Elite Wight**, or custom hallucination). It:
- Deals only [[psychic]] damage with all attacks
- Has the [[illusion]] trait
- Crumbles into nothing when reduced to 0 HP, never returning

Creatures can attempt a **DC 34 Will save** upon interacting or upon seeing something "off" to disbelieve the illusion (this grants them resistance 10 to all its damage and removes the creature’s flat-footed condition from flanking illusions).

---

### Routine (1/minor action per round per PC)

- **Regain Sanity** (mental) — DC 35 Occultism or DC 35 Arcana  
  *Success:* The character recognizes the illusion. Illusory revenants do not attack them for the remainder of the encounter.  
  *Critical Success:* As above, and they grant a +1 status bonus to Regain Sanity checks for allies for the rest of the encounter.  
  *Failure:* The character continues to perceive and be attacked by the illusions.  
  *Critical Failure:* The character is [[confused]] for 1 round as the shard distorts their perception.

- **Resist Delusions** (mental, concentrate) — DC 33 Perception  
  *Success:* Gain resistance 10 to [[psychic]] damage from illusory revenants until the start of your next turn.  
  *Critical Success:* As above, and you gain a +1 status bonus to Will saves vs illusions for 1 minute.

- **Reassure Ally** (auditory, linguistic) — DC 33 Diplomacy or Intimidation  
  *Success:* The next time an adjacent ally fails a Regain Sanity check, they may reroll and use the better result.

### Countermeasures
If all PCs succeed at Regain Sanity, the Chaos Shard goes dormant and the haunt ends. Otherwise, it remains active for the duration of the encounter.

---

### GM Tips
- For higher stakes, illusory revenants can target weak-willed characters first.
- Describe visual distortion, fractured sounds, or impossible physics to heighten the eerie sense of unreality.
