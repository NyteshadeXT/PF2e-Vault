# The Crowd *Hazard 10*  
[complex](complex.md)  [mechanical](mechanical.md)  [unique](unique.md)  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** Automatic detection (no check required to notice the crowd)

A hostile, chaotic crowd hinders movement and lashes out at creatures moving too close. The mass of people can be calmed or dispersed with effort, but their hostility makes progress treacherous.

- **Disable** [[skills#Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] (trained) DC 28 to calm and convince the crowd to disperse peacefully; [[skills#Intimidation|Indimidation]] (trained) DC 26 to scare the crowd into breaking apart; [[skills#Thievery|Thievery]] (trained) DC 28 to exploit the crowd's confusion and disrupt their cohesion.

title: **Lashout** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

**Trigger**: A creature moves adjacent to the crowd.

**Effect** Melee Strike: +20 (reach 5 feet), damage 3d10+8 bludgeoning (representing punches, shoves, and thrown objects).  On **Critical Hit** the target must also succeed at a DC 27 Reflex save or fall [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone)..
```

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine

The crowd lashes out chaotically every round:

**(3 actions)**: The crowd makes a melee Strike against up to three creatures adjacent to it. Each target is attacked individually.
```

**Reset** The crowd regroups 1 minute after dispersing, returning to its full HP unless dispersed by permanent means (e.g., NPC interventions or evacuation).
