# Shield Finesse  
*Source: Everything Shields p. 14*  

Similar to a weapon with the finesse trait, a shield with the finesse trait can be used to make shield attacks and shield bashes utilizing the character's dexterity instead of strength. This also applies to attacks made with any shield attachments or adjustments that the shield has. For example, if you attach a shield boss to a targe, then that shield boss is also considered to have the finesse trait.
