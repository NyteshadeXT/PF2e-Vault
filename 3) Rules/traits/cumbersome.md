# Cumbersome  
*Source: Everything Shields p. 13*  

This shield is heavy or unwieldy, which makes it difficult to move around, especially in tight spaces. Any time you are adjacent to two solid walls, or if you are adjacent to the ceiling and the floor, Raise a Shield becomes a 2-action activity instead of a single action, and any ability with Raise a Shield as a subordinate action fails to Raise the Shield. You take a -2 circumstance penalty to all Acrobatics checks while wielding a shield with this trait.

Shields with this property cannot be wielded while the character is mounted.
