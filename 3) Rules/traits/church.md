# Church  
*Source: Abominations Vaults AP p. 67*  

Faithful characters whose beliefs align with those of the church’s NPC (at your discretion) are permitted to use the location’s resources to retrain more efficiently. Retraining that would normally require a week takes only 5 days at this location, retraining that would normally require a month takes only 3 weeks, and retraining is generally free. Checks to Identify Magic, Treat Wounds, or Treat Disease on site gain a +1 circumstance bonus.
