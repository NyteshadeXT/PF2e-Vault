Here are a bunch of rumors for the Chaos Scar. Some are just general rumors, some are linked to specific adventures. They ascend in order of adventure difficulty. Roll a 1d50. I'd say let each member of the party hear a rumor when they start and then let the party hear up to three more per adventure they complete.

1.  [[Lord Drysdale]] is planning to convert everyone in Restwell Keep to the worship of Waukeen. If they don’t agree they’ll be exiled into the Scar!
2.  ~~We regular folk don’t mean anything to Drysdale. He intends to just use Restwell Keep as a military base to retake the Scar.~~
3.  Some of the Blades are still around and they’re more than eager to get revenge on [[Lord Drysdale]].
4.  [[Gorn Hammerfall]], the Captain of the Guard, has found a forgotten secret chamber with his stone cunning. It contains Greysen Ramthane’s hidden treasure!
5.  The Mages of Saruun come from Thunderspire Mountain and do business with all sorts of unsavory creatures like drow and duregar. Why does [[Lord Drysdale]] allow them to stay here? They can’t be up to any good.
6.  There’s a human cult call the Brotherhood of the Scar that has a fortress deep in the crater.
7.  ~~One hundred years ago a red dragon named Kerang was the terror of the Scar but a wily druid named Merlius poisoned him and then brought the mine down on his head. Word has it among the Fireclaw kobolds that Kerang may be coming back somehow! ([[1F - Some Assembly Required (D208) C]])~~
8.  ~~The Skull Kicker kobolds usually aren't much of a problem but they've become more organized lately and have actually managed to nail a merchant caravan. ([[1J - The Kobold Hall (DMG) C]])~~
9.  ~~There’s an old keep that predates the Scar not too far from the King’s wall. Belonged to a Goliath sorcerer from what I understand. Place is infested with Bullywugs now. ([[1A - Stick in the Mud (D171) C]])~~
10.  ~~There is a cult dedicated to something called Chitteruk not too far into the scar. Their leader, a one armed gnoll called the Hand of Chitteruk, has been capturing people and taking them away to their lair. (Den of the Slavetakers)~~
11.  ~~A pair of Halfling bandits have been terrorizing homesteads and travelers near the Scar. Not only do they steal, they are ruthless murderers. (The Brothers Gray)~~

13.  ~~Not far from the Kings Wall is a cave that emits a strange blue glow. (The Tainted Spiral)~~
14.  ~~Some brigands have been randomly attacking travelers and homesteads near the King’s wall. However these aren't bandit raids as very little is stolen – it is killing for killing sake. (Elves of the Valley)~~
15.  ~~Some crazy-ass goblin named Slaark is demanding tribute from everyone near the Scar. Like [[Lord Drysdale]]'s gonna put up with that! ([[2H - Slaark's Crown (D220) C]])~~
16.  If you follow the road into the Scar, half way in there is a trading post where you can meet with some of the more unsavory residents of the area. ([[2G - The Crossroads (D176)]])
17.  The tiefling who runs the trading post at the Crossroads, Silvereye, often tries to trick and do in visitors who are obviously adventurers. ([[2G - The Crossroads (D176)]])

20.  ~~Somewhere within the Scar is a forest made entirely of glass! ([[2B - The Shrine of Glass-Spire Forest (D175) C]])~~

After Lethion pass away the tower was repeatedly assaulted by orcs and ogres trying to get some treasure he buried with him.

The mercenaries made their base in old tunnels they found beneath a rocky tor in the Scar. ([[4D - Stormcrow Tor (D169)]])
33. ~~Stormcrow Company was credited with cleaning the goblin tribes out of nearby hills and killing a lich who threatened the valley from its dark tower. The adventurers also accepted contracts to assassinate nobles in a neighboring city-state, kidnapped an eladrin princess in return for a ransom of questionable relics, and even slew the good dragon Karonzaxus. In the end, they were feared more than revered.  ([[4D - Stormcrow Tor (D169)]])~~

41.  A frequent visitor to the Chaos Scar is Keljack the Deathless. He’s over a hundred years old yet doesn't look a day over thirty. He’s violently unpredictable, though, especially when near the Scar. A master swordsman you don’t want to mess with. ([[7A - Scarred for Life (D192)]])
42.  A red dragon was seen a few years ago settling itself down into the caves along the crater. No one has seen or heard from it since. Thank the gods. ([[7B - Reflections of Ruin (D196)]])
