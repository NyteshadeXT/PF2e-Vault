### Unique Feature: The Gemstone Lens

Garn possesses a unique artifact known as the "Gemstone Lens," a magical loupe that not only magnifies but also reveals the hidden properties of gems, such as their magical potential or any curses they might carry. This artifact allows Garn to create exceptionally powerful enchanted jewelry, making his shop famous not just for beauty but also for items of real magical value.

## Discovery: The Hidden Gem Mine

Through careful conversation and perhaps a successful Diplomacy or Perception check, players might learn about Garn’s secret source of his finest gems: a hidden mine located deep within the mountains near Bahl Doral. This mine was discovered by Garn’s ancestors and has remained a closely guarded family secret. Adventurers who gain Garn’s trust might be given a quest to explore the mine and help protect it from potential threats, such as greedy rival jewelers or monstrous creatures that have taken up residence within.

## Adventure Hook

One day, a noble from a nearby city commissions Garn to create a crown for an upcoming coronation. The noble insists on using a legendary gem known as the "Heart of the Mountain," said to be hidden deep within the mine. Garn, wary of the mine's dangers, enlists the players to retrieve the gem. The journey involves navigating treacherous tunnels, dealing with territorial creatures, and uncovering ancient dwarven secrets. Along the way, players might discover a deeper conspiracy involving the noble’s true intentions and the gem’s mysterious powers.
