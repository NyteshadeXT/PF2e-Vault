## Unique Features and Discoveries

1. **The Eternal Flame:** The forge is home to an enchanted fire, known as the Eternal Flame, which never extinguishes and burns hotter than normal flames. This allows the blacksmiths to work with rare and difficult metals. Players who investigate the source of this flame might discover it was a gift from a fire elemental as a token of friendship with Thrain’s ancestors.

2. **Runes of Power:** Some of the items crafted at Iron Anvil Forge are inscribed with ancient dwarven runes that provide minor magical enhancements, such as increased durability or sharpness. These runes can only be seen under moonlight, and players might uncover a hidden technique to activate additional powers.

3. **Hidden Legacy:** Behind a concealed door in the storage room lies a secret chamber containing Thrain’s family heirlooms, including a legendary hammer said to possess great power. This chamber also holds old blueprints and designs for creating mythical weapons and armor. Players might be enlisted to find specific materials or uncover the secrets of these ancient designs.

## Adventure Hook

One day, a noble commissions Thrain to create a sword using a rare metal known as Starsteel, which can only be found in a dangerous cavern deep within the nearby mountains. Thrain, unable to leave his forge, asks the players to retrieve the Starsteel. This quest will lead the players through treacherous terrain, battles with subterranean creatures, and the discovery of ancient dwarven ruins. The players might uncover secrets about the metal’s true nature and its connection to the dwarves of Bahl Doral, potentially leading to further adventures involving the forge and its mystical properties.
