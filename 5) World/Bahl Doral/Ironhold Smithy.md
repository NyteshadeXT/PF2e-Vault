## Unique Feature: The Flame of Khazad-dum

The forge at Ironhold Smithy is not just any forge; it is powered by the "Flame of Korak-dum," a magical flame that burns hotter and more consistently than any natural fire. This flame is said to be a gift from a long-forgotten dwarven god of the forge, and it allows Borik and his team to work with rare and difficult-to-forge metals, creating items of unparalleled quality and durability.

## Discovery: The Hidden Vault

A keen-eyed adventurer might notice a series of unusual markings on the floor near the back of the forge. With a successful Perception or Crafting check, they could discover a hidden mechanism that reveals a secret vault beneath the smithy. This vault contains ancient dwarven blueprints for legendary weapons and armor, as well as a small stash of rare materials such as mithral and adamantine. Players who earn Borik's trust might be granted access to these blueprints or materials for a special commission, leading to potential quests to gather additional rare components needed to complete these legendary items.

## Adventure Hook

One day, a mysterious cloaked figure arrives at the smithy, seeking to commission a weapon made from a rare metal known as "Starfall Steel," which is said to be forged from meteorite fragments. The figure's urgency and willingness to pay handsomely arouse suspicion. Borik, concerned about the potential misuse of such a powerful weapon, asks the players to investigate the true identity and intentions of the stranger. This quest could lead the players to uncover a plot involving celestial beings, ancient prophecies, and the fate of Bahl Doral itself.
