## Unique Feature: The Crystal Weave

Among the many furs and leathers, the Frostmantle Furrier offers a rare and unique item known as the "Crystal Weave Cloak." This cloak is interwoven with threads of enchanted ice, granting the wearer resistance to cold and the ability to blend into snowy environments. The secret to crafting these cloaks lies in a special technique passed down through Hilda's family.

## Discovery: The Secret Supply

Adventurers who earn Hilda's trust or succeed in a difficult Perception or Diplomacy check might learn about her secret supply of magical pelts. These pelts come from rare, mystical creatures such as frost wolves and snow leopards, which can be used to create enchanted items. Hilda guards this secret closely, and those who discover it might be offered unique commissions or quests to retrieve more of these rare materials.

## Adventure Hook

One day, a group of hunters comes into the shop with tales of a legendary white stag that roams the frozen peaks near Bahl Doral. The stag's pelt is said to possess powerful magical properties. Hilda sees this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and asks the players to track down and capture the stag without harming it, so its fur can be harvested ethically. This quest will lead the players on a challenging journey through treacherous snowy landscapes, encounters with fierce wildlife, and perhaps even a confrontation with poachers who seek the stag for less noble purposes.
