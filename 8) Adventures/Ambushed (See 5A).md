You also have the matter of the orc chieftain. Po is angry about not getting his slaves and a little snooping around should garner him the names of the characters. He might seek revenge by attacking the adventurers later or mount an attack on Restwell Keep. If, though, the adventurers failed to rescue the prisoners, they might try to locate them and wrest them from the orc. What did he want the slaves for? Where are they? Do they still live?
