## An Unsightly Stone 
The trouble with the Pillar of Eyes is that, for as long as it has stood (and local graybeards swear it has been there for as long as they can remember), it hasn’t done a thing. Not even spooky moaning or phantasms have arisen to indicate that anything is special about it. 

It is certainly a curious piece, an oddity in construction and style suggesting that some inhuman architect might have been responsible for the awful thing. Who else would find beauty in such a grotesque form? Adventurers have suggested it might be a petrified creature, but if this theory is correct, it only raises more questions. What was it before? Why did it turn to stone? No one has yet tested this idea by performing a Remove Affliction ritual—doing so might let loose some hideous eyeball monster on the countryside. Thus, most experts prefer to focus on the more fantastic and wondrous stories attributed to the stone. 

A second, more romantic, theory suggests the pillar was raised to honor the Master of Whispers: old Silence himself, the god Vecna. As anyone with passing knowledge is aware, the Lich Lord has an enduring interest in eyes, due in part to his losing one valuable orb. His cultists often honor their dread master by offering eyes—and hands—to their dark master, whether in flesh or stone. This possibility has drawn the unhealthy interest of a gluttonous barghest, Foosteth the Fat, the most recent in a long line of unhinged and thoroughly wicked villains to obsess over the Pillar’s mysterious powers.

> The pillar is in fact a petrified gibbering mouther that was created from a priest of Vecna who perished in a place touched by the Far Realm. Unlike others of its kind, the aberrant monster retained much of its awareness and knowledge. It slithered into the valley, where it ran afoul of something that turned it to stone. Because of its unique experience, the pillar is important to Vecna’s followers. As well, many cultists with a passion for the forbidden would love to free the imprisoned mouther.

## Foosteth the Fat 
Aside from a predisposition to huskiness, Foosteth would have been an unremarkable barghest—a vile, ravenous monster to be sure, but no different than any others of his kind. His life took an unexpected turn when he gobbled up a priest devoted to Vecna. The priest had come to the Chaos Scar to unlock the power of the Pillar of Eyes, but Foosteth caught him before he had the chance to begin the ritual of Remove Affliction that would release the petrified monster. Not only did the bones yield rich marrow, but the priest’s will persisted beyond the life feeding. His memories and consciousness took root in Foosteth’s mind, filling it with strange thoughts and an obsession with undead—and the mysterious pillar. 

During the weeks that followed, Foosteth acquired some of the dead man’s talents from the devoured memories. He itches to perform the Remove Affliction ritual, but he is not yet powerful enough to control it and lacks the necessary ingredients. Having no treasures worth disenchanting, Foosteth has turned to simple banditry to gather up magic items and distill them down to residuum. In time, he is certain he will accrue the necessary knowledge and experience to meet the ritual’s demands. 

One obstacle blocks the barghest from his dearest desire: his innate lethargy. Foosteth is unwilling to shift his bulk from his noisome throne room, so he relies on underlings to do the robbing for him. Having heard their fat leader go on about the pillar’s fabulous power, a few unscrupulous goblins have got the idea to claim it for themselves and destroy him so they can receive a proper share of the food for once. They are too weak to overpower him but are constantly looking out for opportunities. Foosteth is too absorbed in his own conflicting thoughts to pay them any mind. He waits, patience fraying, for them to bring back the goods so he can get on with the ritual and be done with the accursed stone that torments him.
