![[4B - The Pillar of Eyes (D180)-20240103130655661.webp|locl]]

## An Unsightly Stone 
The trouble with the Pillar of Eyes is that, for as long as it has stood (and local graybeards swear it has been there for as long as they can remember), it hasn’t done a thing. Not even spooky moaning or phantasms have arisen to indicate that anything is special about it. 

It is certainly a curious piece, an oddity in construction and style suggesting that some inhuman architect might have been responsible for the awful thing. Who else would find beauty in such a grotesque form? Adventurers have suggested it might be a petrified creature, but if this theory is correct, it only raises more questions. What was it before? Why did it turn to stone? No one has yet tested this idea by performing a Remove Affliction ritual—doing so might let loose some hideous eyeball monster on the countryside. Thus, most experts prefer to focus on the more fantastic and wondrous stories attributed to the stone. 

A second, more romantic, theory suggests the pillar was raised to honor the Master of Whispers: old Silence himself, the god Vecna. As anyone with passing knowledge is aware, the Lich Lord has an enduring interest in eyes, due in part to his losing one valuable orb. His cultists often honor their dread master by offering eyes—and hands—to their dark master, whether in flesh or stone. This possibility has drawn the unhealthy interest of a gluttonous barghest, Foosteth the Fat, the most recent in a long line of unhinged and thoroughly wicked villains to obsess over the Pillar’s mysterious powers. 

> [!note]+ Call Out
> **Facts about the Pillar**
> 
> The pillar is in fact a petrified gibbering mouther that was created from a priest of Vecna who perished in a place touched by the Far Realm. Unlike others of its kind, the aberrant monster retained much of its awareness and knowledge. It slithered into the valley, where it ran afoul of something that turned it to stone. Because of its unique experience, the pillar is important to Vecna’s followers. As well, many cultists with a passion for the forbidden would love to free the imprisoned mouther.

## Foosteth the Fat 
Aside from a predisposition to huskiness, Foosteth would have been an unremarkable barghest—a vile, ravenous monster to be sure, but no different than any others of his kind. His life took an unexpected turn when he gobbled up a priest devoted to Vecna. The priest had come to the Chaos Scar to unlock the power of the Pillar of Eyes, but Foosteth caught him before he had the chance to begin the ritual of Remove Affliction that would release the petrified monster. Not only did the bones yield rich marrow, but the priest’s will persisted beyond the life feeding. His memories and consciousness took root in Foosteth’s mind, filling it with strange thoughts and an obsession with undead—and the mysterious pillar. 

During the weeks that followed, Foosteth acquired some of the dead man’s talents from the devoured memories. He itches to perform the Remove Affliction ritual, but he is not yet powerful enough to control it and lacks the necessary ingredients. Having no treasures worth disenchanting, Foosteth has turned to simple banditry to gather up magic items and distill them down to residuum. In time, he is certain he will accrue the necessary knowledge and experience to meet the ritual’s demands. 

One obstacle blocks the barghest from his dearest desire: his innate lethargy. Foosteth is unwilling to shift his bulk from his noisome throne room, so he relies on underlings to do the robbing for him. Having heard their fat leader go on about the pillar’s fabulous power, a few unscrupulous goblins have got the idea to claim it for themselves and destroy him so they can receive a proper share of the food for once. They are too weak to overpower him but are constantly looking out for opportunities. Foosteth is too absorbed in his own conflicting thoughts to pay them any mind. He waits, patience fraying, for them to bring back the goods so he can get on with the ritual and be done with the accursed stone that torments him.

# Adventure Hooks
**In Dreams:** Strange and disturbing dreams are bothering the residents near the Scar. Now [[Chendra]] has received a warning from Tymora that the Pillar of Eyes is close to being freed and this must not happen. It must be destroyed, so she seeks out the PCs.

# Running the Adventure
The Pillar of Eyes is within sight of the wall enclosing the valley of the Chaos Scar, so once the characters cross, they can head straight there. How long this takes depends on where they entered the Scar.

When the adventurers can see the Pillar of Eyes, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A monstrous pillar, crooked and spotted with lichen, rises from a crude pedestal in the middle of a green field. Bones litter the ground all around it, suggesting it might be an altar of some kind. The pillar has a lumpy appearance. Closer inspection reveals the reason: It is a giant column of stone eyes.

> [!tip]+ Skill Challenge
> # Investigating the Pillar
> The most notable feature here is the pillar, though the bones might merit some investigation too. The monolith guards its secrets well, and only dedicated study can coax them forth. However, while the adventurers examine the site, goblin wolf riders slowly converge on their position. Should the characters become confused or distracted by their investigation (represented by failing the skill challenge), the goblins can get the drop on them.

> **Primary Skills:**  [[skills#Arcana|Arcana]], [[skills#medicine|Medicine]], [[skills#Nature|Nature]], [[skills#Perception|Perception]] or [[skills#Survival|Survival]], [[skills#Religion|Religion]]
> **Secondary Skills:** None
> 
> ## Primary Skills
> **Arcana (DC 17, one minute; 1 success, 2 successes max):** The character attempts to sense the presence of magic. A successful check contributes 1 success toward the skill challenge and reveals an arcane aura about the pillar. With a second success, the character confirms that the pillar is a petrified creature. Arcana can be used to gain 2 successes in this challenge.
> 
> **Medicine (DC 17, one minute; 2 successes max):** A character near the bones can determine that they all belonged to humanoids. With a second success, the character realizes that the creatures were killed somewhere else; as well, the bones look like something had been chewing on them. Heal can be used to gain 2 successes in this challenge.
> 
> **Nature (DC 17, one minute; 1 success max):** The character tries to identify the creature depicted by the column. A successful check reveals it to be a gibbering mouther, a kind of aberrant magical beast created when a sentient creature dies in an area touched by the Far Realm. Beating the DC by 5 or more allows the character to learn about the creature’s powers. Nature can be used to gain 1 success in this challenge.
> 
> **Perception or Survival (DC 17, one minute; 2 successes max):** The character searches the area. A successful check reveals bestial prints in the soft earth all around the pillar. With a second success, the character learns the direction from which the creatures approached. Perception can be used to gain 2 successes in this challenge.
> 
> **Religion (DC 20,  1 minute; 1 success max):** The character locates and deciphers hidden runes on the pillar’s base. These runes signify some connection to Vecna. Religion can be used to gain 1 success in this challenge.
> 
> ## Secondary Skills
> No secondary skills are used in this challenge.
> 
> ## Success
> If the characters get 6 successes, they learn that the pillar is in fact a petrified creature and that someone or something is delivering bones to the area, which has seen a great deal of traffic. They also detect the goblin wolf riders before they close and thus are not surprised.
> 
> ## Failure 
> The wolf riders surprise the party. After the combat, the characters can retry the skill challenge to pick up any clues they might have missed. Let them keep any successes earned from the first try (a failed effort doesn’t mean they forgot what they had previously learned). However, each time the party fails the challenge after the first costs each character suffers one hit die of damage as the pillar’s malevolent influence gnaws at the soul.
> 
> # Wolf Riders
> Whether or not they succeed at the skill challenge, the adventurers must deal with the wolf riders, goblins charged by Foosteth to plunder explorers that wander into the area.
- [x] Challenge (15 XP)

# Encounter 1 - Howling Host (Level 9)
**Encounter Difficulty:**
- [x] Low (40 XP)

![[4B - The Pillar of Eyes (D180)-20240102170157390.webp|right]]

Creatures:
 - 4: [[hobgoblin-general|Goblin Wolf Rider]] G
 - 4: [[trained-dire-wolf|Trained Dire Wolf]]G

```encounter
name: Howling Host
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 4: [[Hobgoblin General, Goblin Wolf Rider]] 
- 4: [[Trained Dire Wolf]]
```

The wolf riders spot the party from some distance away and close on their position, using natural terrain to cover their approach.

If the party failed the “Investigating the Pillar” skill check (page 6), the goblins have surprise against the adventurers.

When the goblin wolf riders attack, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A growling, barking band of wolves bearing goblins bounds across the field.

## Tactics
The goblins concentrate attacks on tough defenders, using wolf ’s bite against any they knock prone. Otherwise, they use mobile melee attack to strike and move away. They flee if the battle is going against them.

## Features of the Area
**Bones:** Shattered bones litter the area around the pillar. Any creature that is knocked prone in a square containing bones takes 3 extra damage from the jagged splinters.

**Pillar of Eyes:** Any creature that makes an attack while on top of the pillar or in a square adjacent to it ignores cover and concealment (but not superior cover or total concealment). The pillar stands 8 feet tall; climbing it requires a DC 20 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> Other than their equipment, the goblins have nothing of value. However, one carries a bag of bones.

## Development
If the adventurers capture one or more of the wolf riders, they can try to extract useful information.

A character can make a DC 15 [[skills#Perception|Perception]] check to assess the prisoner’s state of mind, fears, or something else useful about its personality. A successful check reveals the goblin is not only unhappy because it is a prisoner but blames its master for its misfortune and would be happy to see him fall. This information grants a +2 bonus to [[skills#Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] and [[skills#Intimidation|Intimidation]] checks against the prisoner.

With a successful DC 16 [[skills#Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] or [[skills#Intimidation|Intimidation]] check, the prisoner reveals that it serves a bugbear, Foosteth the Fat, and that the goblins bring bones to honor the pillar. On a successful DC 23 check, the captive also tells the party that Foosteth wants to awaken the pillar. It admits that the wolf riders attack adventurers to steal their magic, which Foosteth needs for the “ritual of awakening.” The disgruntled goblin also provides directions to the Wolf Den, granting a +2 bonus to all [[skills#Perception|Perception]] checks during the “Tracking the Riders” skill challenge on page 7. (On a failed check, the goblin instead lies about the location and downplays the perils, imposing a –2 penalty on all skill checks during the skill challenge.)

A captured goblin does not participate in combat and flees at the first opportunity.

> [!tip]+ Skill Challenge
> # Tracking the Wolf Riders
> 
> After the characters defeat the wolf riders, they should be able to figure out that the goblins are somehow involved with the pillar. The goblins are carrying bones similar to those surrounding the edifice, which the party can confirm by searching bodies or interrogating prisoners.
> 
> The adventurers can follow the wolf riders’ tracks to discover their lair, represented by the following staged skill challenge. If they capture a goblin during the combat, they might be able to persuade it to help them (see “Development” section above).
> 
> **Level:** 7 (20 xp)
> **Complexity:** 1 (requires 4 successes before 3 failures)
> 
> ## Stage 1: Finding the Way
> The first stage of the challenge involves detecting and following the wolf riders’ tracks. This process should take around half an hour.
> 
> **Primary Skills:**  [[skills#Perception|Perception]], [[skills#Nature|Nature]], [[skills#Survival|Survival]]
> 
> ### Primary Skills
> **Nature or Survival (DC 21, standard action; 1 success, 2 successes max):** The character attempts to follow the goblins’ tracks. Up to two characters can aid this check. A successful check allows the party to continue along the trail, while a failed check means it fades out where the goblins crossed rocky terrain. The characters lose the trail for a time and get lost; they must find the tracks again to continue the chase. In addition to incurring a failure, the characters take a –2 penalty to [[skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] or [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] checks made during stage 2 of this challenge. On a second failure, they also take a –2 penalty to [[skills#stealth|Stealth]] checks made during stage 3 of this challenge. This skill can be used to gain 2 successes in this challenge.
> 
> **Perception (DC 23, standard action; 1 success, 1 success max):** The character examines the manner of the goblins’ approach to deduce the direction they likely came from. This skill can be used to gain 1 success in this challenge.
> 
> ## Stage 2: Unexpected Obstacles
> After achieving 2 successes, the party must deal with hazards and obstacles that might injure or slow them. Getting around these problems takes about an hour.
> 
> **Primary Skills:**  [[skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]], [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]]
> **Secondary Skills:** [[skills#Nature|Nature]], [[skills#Survival|Survival]]
> 
> ### Primary Skills
> **Acrobatics or Athletics (DC 18,  group check; standard action; 1 success, 1 success max):** The party follows the tracks into a forest, where progress is blocked by a dry river bed filled with branches. A successful check means that the characters climb or jump across safely, earning 1 success toward the skill challenge. On a failed group check, the party blunders through the obstacle but still earns 1 success in addition to incurring a failure. In addition, each character who failed the check suffers one hit die of damage from injuries sustained in crossing the terrain and must make a secondary [[skills#Survival|Survival]] check as per the secondary skills entry or suffer a level of fatigue. This skill can be used to gain 1 success in this challenge.
> 
> **Perception (DC 23, minor action; no successes):** The character examines the manner of the goblins’ approach to deduce the direction they likely came from. This skill can be used to gain 1 success in this challenge.
> 
> ### Secondary Skills
> **Survival (DC 18,  standard action; no successes):** Tracking the goblins is an arduous task over difficult ground. A successful check keeps the group moving without undue exhaustion.
> 
> **Nature (DC 16, standard action; no successes):** Nature (DC 14): The character uses his or her knowledge of vegetation and terrain to help the party move past the hazard. A successful check grants a +2 bonus to [[skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] or [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] checks made during the group check described above.
> 
> ## Stage 3: Arrival
> After 3 successes, the characters can approach the goblins’ hideout.
>

> 
> **Thievery (DC 23,  standard action; no successes):** The character uses sneaky tricks to assist the party in finding short cuts through the woods. A success grants a +2 bonus to [[skills#Stealth|Stealth]] checks made during the group check described above. On a failure, the characters instead take a –2 penalty to the [[skills#Stealth|Stealth]] check.
> 
> ## Success
> The adventurers arrive at the goblins’ lair and surprise the sentry outside the entrance.
> 
> ## Failure 
> The adventurers stumble across the Wolf Den, whose sentries are expecting them. Add another goblin wolf rider to Encounter 2.
- [x] Challenge (20 XP)

# The Wolf Den
Foosteth and his goblin followers lair inside the Wolf Den, a stinking mound of dirt, debris, and fallen trees. Its single yawning entrance, littered with leavings and junk, is guarded at all times. Smoke lifts from crooked chimneys rising from the roof, but these gaps are too small to enter.

The interior of the hill is filthy. The walls are made from packed dirt, rocks, and branches held together with spit and excrement. The floors and ceilings are made of the same materials. Rooms are semicircular, with ceilings about half as tall as the rooms are wide.

# Encounter 2 - Foosteth's Sentries (Area 1: Entrance) (level 9)
**Encounter Difficulty:** 
- [x] Severe (80 XP)

![[4B - The Pillar of Eyes (D180)-20240102221129561.webp|right]]

Creatures:
 - 4: [[goblin-archer|Goblin Archer]] G
 - 4: [[bugbear-warrior|Bugbear Warrior]] B

```encounter
name: Foosteth's Sentries
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 4: [[Goblin Archer]] 
- 4: [[Bugbear Warrior]]
```

Several bugbears and goblin wolf riders protect the entrance into the Wolf Den to ensure enemies don’t wander inside.

One bugbear sentry is on guard near the entrance to the mound. The other bugbear and the goblins are inside. They don’t pay much attention to what’s going on outside until the door guard gives the alarm.

When the adventurers enter the mound, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A horrid odor assails your senses, an unwholesome blend of filth, sweat, and smoke. A shoddy wooden pen occupies the far side of this chamber, and a rounded tunnel leads into a dark area beyond.

## Tactics
The sentry retreats into the complex if attacked from outside. The bugbears maneuver for combat advantage whenever possible. The goblins rush up, fire, and then retreat, using perfect position until enemies close, when they instead rely on mobile ranged attack. They focus fire on leaders first and then pick off ranged attackers.

The goblins try to fall back into the common room to retain their ranged advantage while the bugbears cut off escape to the outside. A retreating goblin might try to warn Foosteth or lure enemies into the trap guarding Foosteth’s throne room.

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** Torches on the walls fill the room with bright light.

**Wolf Pen:** Moldy hay covers the floor of this shabby wooden pen, which is closed by a gate with a rope latch. Creatures inside the pen have cover from attacks originating outside the pen.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> The creatures carry assorted coins totaling 2 gp and 7 sp.
> 
> - [ ] gp::2
> - [ ] sp::7

# Area 2: Common Room
When not raiding and plundering, Foosteth’s troops billet in this dark chamber, with goblins along one side and the bugbears the rest. The remains of a cooking fire are in the center, with sleeping pallets strewn all around. Combat from Encounter 2 might spill into this chamber.

# Encounter 3 - Things in the Dark (Area 3: The Chamber of Smells) (Level 9)
**Encounter Difficulty:** 
- [x] Moderate (80 XP)

![[4B - The Pillar of Eyes (D180)-20240103150612027.webp|right]]

Creatures:
 - 2: [[black-pudding|Black Pudding]] R
 - 4: [[ochre-jelly|Ochre Jelly]] S

```encounter
name: Things in the Dark
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 2: [[Black Pudding]] 
- 4: [[Ochre Jelly]]
```

The goblins deposit their rubbish in this sunken area, where slippery, nasty things scuttle forward to eat the offeringss. The creatures here have become aggressive and have snatched more than one incautious goblin.

The ochre jellies hide in the back of the chamber.  Two other, sneakier black puddings hang on the ceiling over the entry passage.

When the adventurers enter this area, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The smell worsens in the dank tunnel, which slopes gently downward. The air is heavy with damp, and the ground is muddy.

When a black pudding on the ceiling attacks, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A glistening black globule drops from above!

**Perception (DC 21):** The character notices the green slimes on the ceiling.

## Tactics
The ochre jellies rush out to attack when they hear noise. The black puddings overhead wait until a character moves underneath. Each readies an action to drop onto the target and gains surprise if it has not been
spotted.  The creatures fight to the death, being unintelligent and having no escape.

## Features of the Area
**Illumination: **This chamber is dark.

# Area 4: Trapped Hall
The madness afflicting Foosteth the Fat has infected him with intense paranoia. His delusion is so strong that he has trapped the passage leading into his personal chambers to give him warning should someone try to get the jump on him.

[[scythe-blades-bb|Footchopper Alarm Trap]] This trap fills a space 2 squares by 2 squares. Stepping on a pressure plate in the eastern 2 squares causes a nasty scythe blade to sweep across the trapped area. A moment later, bells chime, accompanying the chorus of screaming from the trap’s victims.

A successful [[skills#Perception|Perception]] check reveals a 2-inch tall groove running parallel to the floor for about 10 feet. Dirt and rocks fill the gap. A Critical Success is needed to recognize the pressure plate on the floor.  A secret panel on the opposite side of the pressure plate (requiring a DC 21 [[skills#Perception|Perception]] check to find) can shut off or reset the trap. Characters can also use [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] to jump over the trapped area if they know where it is.

# Encounter 4 - Unhinged Mind (Area 5: Hall of Whispers) (Level 4)
**Encounter Difficulty:** 
- [ ] Severe (140 XP)

![[4B - The Pillar of Eyes (D180)-20240103150642656.webp|right|600]]

Creatures:
 - 2: [[trained-dire-wolf|Trained Dire Wolf]] W
 - 4: [[bugbear-warrior|Bugbear Warrior]] B
 - 4: [[gnoll-warfang|Gnoll Warfang]] N
 - 1: [[Foosteth]] F

```encounter
name: Foosteth's Sentries
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 2: [[Trained Dire Wolf]] 
- 4: [[Bugbear Warrior]]
- 5: [[Gnoll Warfang], hidden]
- 1: [[Foosteth]]
```

Foosteth lurks in this room, attended by guards, pets, and goblin slaves who serve him in his personal quarters.

Do not place the goblins on the map at the start of combat. They are hiding behind the curtain and do not join the fight until the third round.

When the characters enter the Hall of Whispers, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The hallway opens into a roundish chamber. Seated in a throne made from sharpened bones is a profoundly obese bugbear. A gaudy tapestry stinking of mildew hangs across from the gruesome throne, which is topped by a humanoid skull. Four tough-looking bugbears stand guard nearby. A pair of shaggy wolves growl near a curtain against the far wall.

The adventurers have surprise if they bypassed the footchopper alarm trap in area 4, since Foosteth is confident that the trap will warn him against intruders. Otherwise, all the creatures in the room are ready and waiting.

## Tactics
Foosteth begins by taking wolf form, then springs from his throne with jump strike to attack the closest enemy. When he sees an enemy use an interesting ability, he attacks that target with power feed. If he becomes bloodied and hasn’t yet used power feed, he uses it to gain an enemy’s at-will power. Foosteth exploits aura of madness to draw the adventurers deeper into the room and also to position his servants to get combat advantage when possible.

The bugbears wheel out to either side of Foosteth, maneuvering to flank enemies with him. The dire wolves charge the nearest enemy and then stay as close as possible to Foosteth or a bugbear so they can knock enemies prone.

At the start of the third round of combat, the goblin slaves roll initiative. They come through the curtain and focus against any enemy that’s not already engaged in melee.

All creatures except the bugbears fight to the death. The bugbears are willing to sacrifice themselves only so long as Foosteth lives. If he falls, they attempt to flee when reduced to 15 or fewer hit points.

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** Candles burn in wall nooks in the walls throughout the throne room and Foosteth’s quarters, filling the area with dim light.

**Curtain:** A heavy curtain separates the throne room from Foosteth’s quarters. Entering a square containing the curtain costs 2 squares of movement. A DC 10 Strength check (single action) pulls the
curtain down.

**Jagged Throne:** A hideous chair made from human bones stands against the south wall. The bones jab out at odd angles. Any creature forcibly moved into the throne’s space takes 5 damage.

**Possessed Skull:** Foosteth has attached the skull of the slain cultist to his throne as a trophy. When the barghest Foosteth is slain, the cultist’s essence slips free and returns to the skull. The skull’s eye sockets glow with power, and it rolls initiative and attacks.

![[4B - The Pillar of Eyes (D180)-20240103152932829.webp]]

**Tapestry:** A mildewed tapestry hangs on the north wall, depicting battle scenes involving various humanoids. It is too damaged to be worth anything but can be pulled off the wall to hinder nearby enemies.

![[4B - The Pillar of Eyes (D180)-20240103153617510.webp]]

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> Foosteth keeps his loot in a pile in his quarters. It includes a +1 Dueling Spear, [[dragonscale-staff-tv|Dragonscale Staff]], a [[preserving-tv|Preserving (Greater) Wooden Shield]], a [[mistform-elixir|Mistform Elixir]], [[powered-full-plate-tv|Powered Full Plate]], a [[malleable-mixture-lotgb|Malleable Mixture (Lesser)]], 97 gp and 6 sp.

# Conclusion
Defeating Foosteth and his goblins removes only one agency with designs on freeing the gibbering mouther. Eventually, some other lunatic will try to finish the job. The adventurers might decide to destroy the statue, thus raising the ire of Those Who Hear (4th Edition D&D Dungeon Master’s Guide 2, page 120). The cultists might want to take revenge for the statue’s destruction.

The question remains as to what turned the monster to stone in the first place. Was it a basilisk, a medusa, or something more dangerous, such as a beholder? The petrification might have been the result of a chance meeting, or it could serve some darker, more sinister purpose.
