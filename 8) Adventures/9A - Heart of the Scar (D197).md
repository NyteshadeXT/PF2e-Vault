# Background
The Far Realm is home to countless alien abominations, some of which rival the mightiest gods in power. Occasionally, these great entities clash over motives and machinations far beyond the ken of mortal minds. Rarer still, one of these terrible beings is defeated, stripped of its power, and hurled into the dark cosmos to wander the void for eternity. 

Such was the fate of the entity known as Shoth-Gorag. However, Shoth-Gorag had made inroads into the world of mortals, attracting the attention of warlocks and mad cultists. Banished from its domain in the Far Realm, Shoth-Gorag made a pact with the fledgling deity, Kataclysmos.  Using what remained of its power and energy passed to it by Kataclysmos it passed into the mortal world, in hopes that it might go unnoticed and slowly rebuild its strength. 

Shoth-Gorag’s physical form had been destroyed, and all that remained of the malign entity was its heart, a calcified chunk of unspeakable evil. This rock shot across the cosmos and impacted the world centuries ago, carving out what is now called the Chaos Scar. After the heart fell, a group of Banites discovered it. Mistaking the heart for a gift from their tyrannical deity, they took it. Around it, high on the cliffs above the Chaos Scar, they built a small fortress temple they named Hallowgaunt. 

The heart of Shoth-Gorag became the center of worship for the Banites. From their temple, the heart began to exert its influence, inundating the surrounding area with its evil. Its presence acted as clarion call to wicked creatures, and such monsters began to come to the Chaos Scar in great numbers. Over the years, Shoth-Gorag has fed on the constant violence and turmoil in the valley. 

Shoth-Gorag has also been poisoning the minds of the Banites in Hallowgaunt. Banite clerics there draw some of their strength directly from Shoth-Gorag. Its influence has also begun to twist the bodies of these misguided servitors, and some of them have bizarre deformities indicative of exposure to the Far Realm’s chaotic energy. These Banites have come to call themselves the Brotherhood of the Scar. 

While gaining mastery over Hallowgaunt, Shoth-Gorag has also amassed enough power to begin the final phase of its plans. It is undergoing a hideous resurgence, building a physical body worthy of a Far Realm lord. To build this physical form, Shoth-Gorag requires ample supplies of flesh. It has been sending out its most trusted servants, members of the Brotherhood of the Scar, to capture creatures great and small. Any unfortunates these Banites capture are dragged back to Hallowgaunt to be tortured out of their wits and cast down to where Shoth-Gorag dwells deep under the fortress. 

Shoth-Gorag absorbs those brought to it, using their flesh as raw material to construct a horrific body around its heart. Soon, Shoth-Gorag will be powerful enough to move beyond the temple of Bane and begin absorbing the myriad creatures dwelling in the Chaos Scar. Their evil, insanity, and flesh will become its own, until nothing remains except Shoth-Gorag and its truest servants. 

Although Shoth-Gorag now controls a majority of the priests and soldiers serving in Hallowgaunt, a small group of temple guards loyal to Bane resisted the Far Realm lord’s growing influence. These faithful Banites surreptitiously sought aid from their allies outside the Chaos Scar, seeking is a means to destroy Shoth-Gorag and return the temple to Bane. 

Another temple sent a potent relic to its allies in the Chaos Scar. This item, a powerful warhammer called Farbane, was crafted to destroy interlopers from the Far Realm. Shortly after the hammer arrived, however, Shoth-Gorag became aware of the insurrection. Shoth-Gorag’s loyalists attacked the rebellious Banites and seized Farbane. Most of Bane’s true servants were slain or captured for torture. Shoth-Gorag then called forth a potent aberrant guardian for Hallowgaunt’s reliquary, where Farbane is now stored. 

A fraction of the faithful Banites managed to escape Shoth-Gorag’s purging. Most perished during their escape or while crossing the Chaos Scar with the Brotherhood of the Scar in pursuit. However, one made it to the King’s Wall. This surviving Banite, a human named Yorven, hopes to find allies powerful enough to end Shoth-Gorag’s growing threat.

# Adventure Synopsis
While traveling into or out of the Chaos Scar, the party discovers a wounded Banite under attack. The wounded human is Yorven. His assailants are members of the Brotherhood of the Scar. After defeating the members of the Brotherhood of the Scar and, perhaps, rescuing Yorven, the party gains most of the information presented in the Background section. Yorven, if he lives, asks the party to travel to Hallowgaunt and destroy the horrific evil within.

From information Yorven shares or carries with him, the characters find they can gain access to Hallowgaunt through a secret tunnel that runs underneath. This tunnel is the means by which Yorven and some of his allies escaped, but other loyal servants of Bane might remain within the temple and be willing to lend a hand against Shoth-Gorag. The adventurers also learn of the warhammer Farbane. If the party can infiltrate the temple and claim the weapon, Farbane can help destroy Shoth-Gorag.

Armed with Yorven’s information, the adventurers make their way through the Chaos Scar to the base of the great cliffs, atop which sits the fortress-temple of Hallowgaunt. They find Yorven’s secret tunnel and navigate its dark passages up into the first level of the temple. Inside, the characters face the first lines of the Brotherhood of the Scar’s defenses.

The adventurers then proceed down to the second level. Horrific creatures from or polluted by the Far Realm lurk here. As the characters win through, they can claim Farbane and gain aid from a small group of faithful Banites held prisoner here. 

Likely with Farbane in hand, the adventurers can make their way to the third level, a cavernous chamber carved from the bedrock of the cliffs. Here awaits the cosmic horror of Shoth-Gorag and a battle the characters will not soon forget . . . if they survive.

# Dark Rumors
This adventure assumes the characters have prior experience in the Chaos Scar, and that they are acquainted with its history and perils. As veteran adventurers, the characters have likely heard rumors about the Brotherhood of the Scar. [[gather-information|Gather Information]] checks can grant the following information.
 
[[gather-information|Gather Information]] DC 32: The Brotherhood of the Scar has been more active in the Chaos Scar lately.
 
[[gather-information|Gather Information]] DC 34: Small, well-armed groups of brotherhood soldiers have been spotted attacking monsters and humanoids within the Chaos Scar. These raids are to capture rather than kill.
 
[[gather-information|Gather Information]] DC 36: Brotherhood soldiers have been taking captives to Hallowgaunt, where the brotherhood must be building a slave army or something worse.

## Introduction
The adventure starts as the characters near the King’s Wall during a journey into or out of the Chaos Scar.

As the adventurers near the King’s Wall, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The King’s Wall looms ahead, rising over dense trees that dominate this area of the Chaos Scar. Breaches in the wall are common and easily used to pass in and out of the valley. One of these breaches lies ahead within a clearing, and the sound of battle comes from nearby.

### Beleaguered Banite 
As the characters approach the breach in the King’s Wall, they hear a confrontation unfolding.

When adventurers approach the breach, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Ahead, beyond the breach in the wall, three warriors, one clad in chainmail and the others in leather armor, stand in a loose circle with two massive war dogs around a fourth warrior, a human male. Each warrior has the symbol of an upright black right hand with it's thumb and fingers together. The surrounded human has one hand clamped over his side, and blood pours between his clenched fingers.

Any character trained in [[skills#Religion|Religion]] can see that all the warriors, including Yorven, wear the symbol of Bane. The brotherhood members are focused on Yorven, so any attempt at stealth allows the characters to move closer, overhear the conversation presented below, and learn more about the situation.

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> **Priest:** “Yorven, you can’t escape us. Submit, and the master might show mercy. There is no help for you now.”
> 
> **Yorven:** “The only master I serve is Bane. The foul creature you serve profanes our lord’s temple.”
>
> **Priest:** “We serve the master of the temple, the master of this valley, and soon, the master of this world. You fight the inevitable.”
> 
> **Yorven:** “What of my comrades? What have you done with them?”
> 
> **Priest:** “Soon, their flesh shall be added to the master’s, their knowledge to its knowledge, their strength to its strength. One could not wish for a more glorious end.”
> 
> **Yorven:** “Fools! Your master will consume you all. Find your faith! Return to Bane! Help me seek aid to end this blight on our creed.”
> 
> **Priest:** “The master grows strong. It shall devour all who stand against it. Those who remain faithful shall be allowed to serve. At the end of all things, not even Bane can offer sanctuary from mighty Shoth-Gorag.”
> 
> **Yorven:** (He spits on the ground.)
> 
> **Priest:** “Slay this fool, and let us be done with this.”

The adventurers can interrupt at any time. Otherwise, when the tainted Banites move in for the kill, the hounds notice one or more of the characters. The brotherhood members attack the adventurers.

## Encounter 1:  My Enemy's Enemies
**Encounter Difficulty:**   
- [ ] Severe (85 XP) Level 15
![[9A - Heart of the Scar (D197)-1757880711426.webp|right]]

When the fight begins, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Subtle differences distinguish Yorven and those who threaten him. Yorven is undeniably human, but his attackers all bear strange deformities such as spines, horns, and other bizarre growths on exposed flesh. Their chainmail clad leader is the most deformed—his skin is translucent white, exposing the veins and muscle beneath.

```encounter
name: My Enemy's Enemies
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 2: Slug Rabbit
- 2: Tongue Wolf, hidden
```

Setup
 1 tainted warpriest (T)
 2 tainted scouts (S)
 2 war hounds (W)
 Yorven (Y)

### Features of the Area
**Illumination:** Bright light (daylight).
**King’s Wall:** The wall is 15 feet high ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] DC 32 to climb). It is 5 feet thick in this area. The top of the wall is rough, so it’s difficult terrain. 
**Trees:** Smaller trees are 20 feet tall, and the larger-trunked ones are 30 feet tall. Their trunks are blocking terrain that can be climbed. Above half a given tree’s height, thick leaves render the tree’s area lightly obscured.
**Rubble:** A large section of the wall has collapsed, covering the area in rubble that is difficult terrain.

 Conclusion
 Even if Yorven dies, the characters can acquire the 
information they need for the adventure to proceed. 
See “A Banite in Need.”
Tactics
 The warpriest closes in and uses force tremor. He then 
wades into melee with his mace, targeting prone 
characters. If he has no melee targets available, he 
uses grasping terror.
 Scouts and war hounds enter melee to protect the 
warpriest. The scouts shift to flank their foes or use 
swift repositioning to quickly assault a prone target 
with brutal stab. Once a war hound has grabbed an 
enemy, it keeps that enemy grabbed and prone.
 Yorven: Too wounded to offer much assistance, 
Yorven retreats to the nearby woods. He might aid 
the characters if they falter. If necessary, use Banite 
captain statistics (page 10), but Yorven has only 25 hit 
points remaining.











#### Banite in Need
Once the adventurers have defeated the tainted Ban
ites, Yorven approaches them. If Yorven is dead, the 
party finds on his body a report intended for other 
Banites. This report contains all the necessary infor
mation to inform the adventurers of the situation. If 
you wish to create other adventures against Banites, 
the report could also indicate the location of another 
secret Banite stronghold.
 If Yorven lives at the battle’s end, read:
 The wounded human moves slowly toward you, grimacing 
with each footstep. He says nothing for a few moments, his 
face set as he looks you over. Then, he frowns, gestures at 
the corpses strewn around the clearing, and says, “You did 
for these traitorous bastards. You’ll do.”

 Heart of the Scar
 Yorven is entirely forthcoming about the situation at 
Hallowgaunt. He sees the characters’ timely arrival 
as a sign from Bane. If the adventurers doubt Yorven, 
a few successful DC 12 Insight checks tell them he is 
honest and frightened. The characters should receive 
the following information.
 F The meteor that carved the Chaos Scar is not a 
mere rock. It is the malign heart of a horrid entity 
from beyond space and time.
 F Worshipers of Bane found the meteor and took it 
back to Hallowgaunt. They believed the meteor to 
be a gift from Bane, and it became central to the 
temple’s worship. (Yorven identifies the symbol he 
wears as that of Bane.) The Banites at Hallowgaunt 
named their cult the Brotherhood of the Scar.
 F Over the last few years, the meteor regained its 
awareness. It began exerting its will over the 
Brotherhood of the Scar.
 F In the last year, the meteor revealed itself as a 
malignant entity called Shoth-Gorag. It has cor
rupted the majority of the Banites and swayed 
them to worship it instead of Bane. Its most fervent 
servants have been tasked with bringing flesh to 
their master so that it can construct a body around 
its heart.
 F Yorven was part of a splinter group that resisted 
Shoth-Gorag and sought to destroy it. This group 
sent word to allies and received a great relic, the 
warhammer Farbane. Yorven believes Farbane can 
destroy the meteor that is Shoth-Gorag’s heart. 
Yorven knows the hammer is still within the 
temple, but not where.
 F Shoth-Gorag discovered the splinter group, and 
battle ensued in the temple. Some, including 
Yorven, decided they must take word to other 
Banites. They fled through a secret tunnel under 
Hallowgaunt. The Brotherhood of the Scar pur
sued, and Yorven was the only one to survive the 
trek across the Chaos Scar.
 F Loyal Banites might yet live within the temple, 
probably in the fort’s prison. They are likely to aid 
anyone seeking to destroy Shoth-Gorag.
 F Yorven believes that Shoth-Gorag is growing in 
power and might soon be powerful enough to 
move beyond the temple and exert its dominance 
over the Chaos Scar and the surrounding lands.
 Fill in additional details from the Background and 
Adventure Synopsis sections as you see fit. After tell
ing his tale, Yorven departs, heading for Restwell 
Keep. Unless you wish to keep him around as a com
panion character, he refuses to aid the party further.
 Shoth-Gorag
 Characters skilled in Dungeoneering might know 
more about Shoth-Gorag.
 Dungeoneering DC 12: The name Shoth-Gorag 
and Yorven’s description of the entity suggest the 
creature is native to the Far Realm.
 Dungeoneering DC 17: Centuries ago, certain 
warlocks who drew power from the Far Realm did so 
in the name of an entity called Shoth-Gorag.
 Dungeoneering DC 25: Most of the creatures 
inhabiting the Far Realm are nameless horrors. Those 
with names, such as Shoth-Gorag, are often powerful 
beings that can rival the gods in power. 
Quests
 You might give the characters quests at this point. 
Minor quests could include locating any surviving 
Banites in Hallowgaunt and gaining their informa
tion, as well as locating and recovering Farbane. The 
major quest of the adventure might be to destroy 
Shoth-Gorag’s heart with Farbane.
