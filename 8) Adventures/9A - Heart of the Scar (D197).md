# Background
The Far Realm is home to countless alien abominations, some of which rival the mightiest gods in power. Occasionally, these great entities clash over motives and machinations far beyond the ken of mortal minds. Rarer still, one of these terrible beings is defeated, stripped of its power, and hurled into the dark cosmos to wander the void for eternity. 

Such was the fate of the entity known as Shoth-Gorag. However, Shoth-Gorag had made inroads into the world of mortals, attracting the attention of warlocks and mad cultists. Banished from its domain in the Far Realm, Shoth-Gorag made a pact with the fledgling deity, Kataclysmos.  Using what remained of its power and energy passed to it by Kataclysmos it passed into the mortal world, in hopes that it might go unnoticed and slowly rebuild its strength. 

Shoth-Gorag’s physical form had been destroyed, and all that remained of the malign entity was its heart, a calcified chunk of unspeakable evil. This rock shot across the cosmos and impacted the world centuries ago, carving out what is now called the Chaos Scar. After the heart fell, a group of Banites discovered it. Mistaking the heart for a gift from their tyrannical deity, they took it. Around it, high on the cliffs above the Chaos Scar, they built a small fortress temple they named Hallowgaunt. 

The heart of Shoth-Gorag became the center of worship for the Banites. From their temple, the heart began to exert its influence, inundating the surrounding area with its evil. Its presence acted as clarion call to wicked creatures, and such monsters began to come to the Chaos Scar in great numbers. Over the years, Shoth-Gorag has fed on the constant violence and turmoil in the valley. 

Shoth-Gorag has also been poisoning the minds of the Banites in Hallowgaunt. Banite clerics there draw some of their strength directly from Shoth-Gorag. Its influence has also begun to twist the bodies of these misguided servitors, and some of them have bizarre deformities indicative of exposure to the Far Realm’s chaotic energy. These Banites have come to call themselves the Brotherhood of the Scar. 

While gaining mastery over Hallowgaunt, Shoth-Gorag has also amassed enough power to begin the final phase of its plans. It is undergoing a hideous resurgence, building a physical body worthy of a Far Realm lord. To build this physical form, Shoth-Gorag requires ample supplies of flesh. It has been sending out its most trusted servants, members of the Brotherhood of the Scar, to capture creatures great and small. Any unfortunates these Banites capture are dragged back to Hallowgaunt to be tortured out of their wits and cast down to where Shoth-Gorag dwells deep under the fortress. 

Shoth-Gorag absorbs those brought to it, using their flesh as raw material to construct a horrific body around its heart. Soon, Shoth-Gorag will be powerful enough to move beyond the temple of Bane and begin absorbing the myriad creatures dwelling in the Chaos Scar. Their evil, insanity, and flesh will become its own, until nothing remains except Shoth-Gorag and its truest servants. 

Although Shoth-Gorag now controls a majority of the priests and soldiers serving in Hallowgaunt, a small group of temple guards loyal to Bane resisted the Far Realm lord’s growing influence. These faithful Banites surreptitiously sought aid from their allies outside the Chaos Scar, seeking is a means to destroy Shoth-Gorag and return the temple to Bane. 

Another temple sent a potent relic to its allies in the Chaos Scar. This item, a powerful warhammer called Farbane, was crafted to destroy interlopers from the Far Realm. Shortly after the hammer arrived, however, Shoth-Gorag became aware of the insurrection. Shoth-Gorag’s loyalists attacked the rebellious Banites and seized Farbane. Most of Bane’s true servants were slain or captured for torture. Shoth-Gorag then called forth a potent aberrant guardian for Hallowgaunt’s reliquary, where Farbane is now stored. 

A fraction of the faithful Banites managed to escape Shoth-Gorag’s purging. Most perished during their escape or while crossing the Chaos Scar with the Brotherhood of the Scar in pursuit. However, one made it to the King’s Wall. This surviving Banite, a human named Yorven, hopes to find allies powerful enough to end Shoth-Gorag’s growing threat.

# Adventure Synopsis
While traveling into or out of the Chaos Scar, the party discovers a wounded Banite under attack. The wounded human is Yorven. His assailants are members of the Brotherhood of the Scar. After defeating the members of the Brotherhood of the Scar and, perhaps, rescuing Yorven, the party gains most of the information presented in the Background section. Yorven, if he lives, asks the party to travel to Hallowgaunt and destroy the horrific evil within.

From information Yorven shares or carries with him, the characters find they can gain access to Hallowgaunt through a secret tunnel that runs underneath. This tunnel is the means by which Yorven and some of his allies escaped, but other loyal servants of Bane might remain within the temple and be willing to lend a hand against Shoth-Gorag. The adventurers also learn of the warhammer Farbane. If the party can infiltrate the temple and claim the weapon, Farbane can help destroy Shoth-Gorag.

Armed with Yorven’s information, the adventurers make their way through the Chaos Scar to the base of the great cliffs, atop which sits the fortress-temple of Hallowgaunt. They find Yorven’s secret tunnel and navigate its dark passages up into the first level of the temple. Inside, the characters face the first lines of the Brotherhood of the Scar’s defenses.

The adventurers then proceed down to the second level. Horrific creatures from or polluted by the Far Realm lurk here. As the characters win through, they can claim Farbane and gain aid from a small group of faithful Banites held prisoner here. 

Likely with Farbane in hand, the adventurers can make their way to the third level, a cavernous chamber carved from the bedrock of the cliffs. Here awaits the cosmic horror of Shoth-Gorag and a battle the characters will not soon forget . . . if they survive.

## The Lost Weeks
When consciousness returns, the heroes lie just outside the King’s Wall, dew-damp grass under their hands, birdsong echoing through an uneasy stillness. The air feels _thin_, stretched—like the world has been holding its breath.

> [!note]+ Read Aloud  
> The morning sun feels wrong—too bright, too close. The ground hums with a distant heartbeat. In the distance, the King’s Wall glows faintly red where dew should sparkle silver.

### Discoveries
**Time Skip:** A simple investigation ([[skills#Society|Society]] DC 25 or [[skills#Nature|Nature]] DC 23) reveals that at least three weeks have passed—fresh growth, moon cycle mismatch.
**Restwell Keep Reports:** Scratched symbols and carved warnings on tree trunks speak of _earthquakes_ and _crimson auroras_. A half-rotted traveler’s journal mentions a “Starquake” that cracked the Keep’s walls.
**Divine Disturbance:** Clerics find prayers returning faint and delayed; holy symbols warm or flicker.

## “Restwell in Dread”
Half-collapsed parapets, crimson cracks glowing faintly through stone, banners stiff with dried dust.  Fear and exhaustion. Every conversation stops when the party appears. The townsfolk thought them dead since the “Starquake.” Children whisper that “the lost ones came back wrong.”

## Familiar Echos
As twilight falls that evening, the party notices the red star again—far larger now, almost a second moon very close to Aetheria existing moon.

The PCs faintly hear a voice carried on the wind, mournful and distant:

> [!note]+ Read Aloud  
> The twin orbs hang side by side—the moon pale and cold, the star burning gold-red and alive.  A warm wind stirs, carrying a voice you remember from a dream of lanterns and masks:  
> 
> “I told you to watch the sky. It’s closer than you think… It’s time. Investigate the Scar…”  
> 
> For an instant, golden-orange Feywild light circles you like candle-flame—then snuffs out, devoured by the red glow overhead.

Mechanically, this confirms that planar boundaries are eroding; teleportation or planar travel checks now carry a 5 % failure chance until the meteor falls.

## “Through the Scar”
When the heroes depart Restwell back toward the Scar, the scar’s decay mirrors the time skip:
- Trees lean toward the meteor as though bowing.
- Ground pulses underfoot—each tremor a heartbeat.
- Sky bleeds red along the horizon; nights lengthen, dawn arrives late.


### Beleaguered Banite 
As the characters approach the breach in the King’s Wall, they hear a confrontation unfolding.

When adventurers approach the breach, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Ahead, beyond the breach in the wall, three warriors, one clad in chainmail and the others in leather armor, stand in a loose circle with two massive war dogs around a fourth warrior, a human male. Each warrior has the symbol of an upright black right hand with it's thumb and fingers together. The surrounded human has one hand clamped over his side, and blood pours between his clenched fingers.

Any character trained in [[skills#Religion|Religion]] can see that all the warriors, including Yorven, wear the symbol of Bane. The brotherhood members are focused on Yorven, so any attempt at stealth allows the characters to move closer, overhear the conversation presented below, and learn more about the situation.

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> **Priest:** “Yorven, you can’t escape us. Submit, and the master might show mercy. There is no help for you now.”
> 
> **Yorven:** “The only master I serve is Bane. The foul creature you serve profanes our lord’s temple.”
>
> **Priest:** “We serve the master of the temple, the master of this valley, and soon, the master of this world. You fight the inevitable.”
> 
> **Yorven:** “What of my comrades? What have you done with them?”
> 
> **Priest:** “Soon, their flesh shall be added to the master’s, their knowledge to its knowledge, their strength to its strength. One could not wish for a more glorious end.”
> 
> **Yorven:** “Fools! Your master will consume you all. Find your faith! Return to Bane! Help me seek aid to end this blight on our creed.”
> 
> **Priest:** “The master grows strong. It shall devour all who stand against it. Those who remain faithful shall be allowed to serve. At the end of all things, not even Bane can offer sanctuary from mighty Shoth-Gorag.”
> 
> **Yorven:** (He spits on the ground.)
> 
> **Priest:** “Slay this fool, and let us be done with this.”

The adventurers can interrupt at any time. Otherwise, when the tainted Banites move in for the kill, the hounds notice one or more of the characters. The brotherhood members attack the adventurers.

## Encounter 1:  My Enemy's Enemies
**Encounter Difficulty:**   
- [ ] Severe (110 XP) Level 15

![[9A - Heart of the Scar (D197)-1757880711426.webp|left wmed]]

When the fight begins, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Subtle differences distinguish Yorven and those who threaten him. Yorven is undeniably human, but his attackers all bear strange deformities such as spines, horns, and other bizarre growths on exposed flesh. Their chainmail clad leader is the most deformed—his skin is translucent white, exposing the veins and muscle beneath.

```encounter
name: My Enemy's Enemies
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 2: Corrupt Scout of Bane
- 1: Corrupt Priest of Bane
- 2: Corrupt Bane Hound
- 1: Yorven, 225, 35, 2
```

### Tactics
The warpriest closes in and uses force tremor. He then wades into melee with his mace, targeting prone characters. If he has no melee targets available, he uses grasping terror.

Scouts and war hounds enter melee to protect the warpriest. The scouts shift to flank their foes or use swift repositioning to quickly assault a prone target with brutal stab. Once a war hound has grabbed an enemy, it keeps that enemy grabbed and prone.

**Yorven:** Too wounded to offer much assistance, Yorven retreats to the nearby woods. He might aid the characters if they falter. If necessary, use Banite captain statistics (page 10), but Yorven has only 25 hit points remaining.

### Features of the Area
**Illumination:** Bright light (daylight).
**King’s Wall:** The wall is 15 feet high ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] DC 32 to climb). It is 5 feet thick in this area. The top of the wall is rough, so it’s difficult terrain. 
**Trees:** Smaller trees are 20 feet tall, and the larger-trunked ones are 30 feet tall. Their trunks are blocking terrain that can be climbed. Above half a given tree’s height, thick leaves render the tree’s area lightly obscured.
**Rubble:** A large section of the wall has collapsed, covering the area in rubble that is difficult terrain.

### Conclusion
Even if Yorven dies, the characters can acquire the information they need for the adventure to proceed.  See “A Banite in Need.”

## Banite in Need
Once the adventurers have defeated the tainted Banites, Yorven approaches them. If Yorven is dead, the party finds on his body a report intended for other Banites. This report contains all the necessary information to inform the adventurers of the situation.

If Yorven lives at the battle’s end, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The wounded human moves slowly toward you, grimacing with each footstep. He says nothing for a few moments, his face set as he looks you over. Then, he frowns, gestures at the corpses strewn around the clearing, and says, “You did for these traitorous bastards. You’ll do.”

Yorven is entirely forthcoming about the situation at Hallowgaunt. He sees the characters’ timely arrival as a sign from Bane. If the adventurers doubt Yorven, a few successful DC 34 [[skills#Perception|Perception]] checks tell them he is honest and frightened. The characters should receive the following information.

- The meteor that carved the Chaos Scar is not a mere rock. It is the malign heart of a horrid entity from beyond space and time.
- Worshipers of Bane found the meteor and took it back to Hallowgaunt. They believed the meteor to be a gift from Bane, and it became central to the temple’s worship. (Yorven identifies the symbol he wears as that of Bane.) The Banites at Hallowgaunt named their cult the Brotherhood of the Scar.
- Over the last few years, the meteor regained its awareness. It began exerting its will over the Brotherhood of the Scar.
- In the last year, the meteor revealed itself as a malignant entity called Shoth-Gorag. It has corrupted the majority of the Banites and swayed them to worship it instead of Bane. Its most fervent servants have been tasked with bringing flesh to their master so that it can construct a body around its heart.
- Yorven was part of a splinter group that resisted Shoth-Gorag and sought to destroy it. This group sent word to allies and received a great relic, the warhammer Farbane. Yorven believes Farbane can destroy the meteor that is Shoth-Gorag’s heart. Yorven knows the hammer is still within the temple, but not where.
- Shoth-Gorag discovered the splinter group, and battle ensued in the temple. Some, including Yorven, decided they must take word to other Banites. They fled through a secret tunnel under Hallowgaunt. The Brotherhood of the Scar pursued, and Yorven was the only one to survive the trek across the Chaos Scar.
- Loyal Banites might yet live within the temple, probably in the fort’s prison. They are likely to aid anyone seeking to destroy Shoth-Gorag.
- Yorven believes that Shoth-Gorag is growing in power and might soon be powerful enough to move beyond the temple and exert its dominance over the Chaos Scar and the surrounding lands.

Fill in additional details from the Background and Adventure Synopsis sections as you see fit. After telling his tale, Yorven departs, heading for Restwell Keep. Unless you wish to keep him around as a companion character, he refuses to aid the party further.

### Shoth-Gorag
Characters skilled in [[skills#Occultism|Occultism]] might know more about Shoth-Gorag.

[[skills#Occultism|Occultism]] DC 34: The name Shoth-Gorag and Yorven’s description of the entity suggest the creature is native to the Far Realm.
[[skills#Occultism|Occultism]] DC 36: Centuries ago, certain warlocks who drew power from the Far Realm did so in the name of an entity called Shoth-Gorag.
[[skills#Occultism|Occultism]] DC 39: Most of the creatures inhabiting the Far Realm are nameless horrors. Those with names, such as Shoth-Gorag, are often powerful beings that can rival the gods in power. 

## Tunnel to Temple
Armed with the information from Yorven, the adventurers trek across the Chaos Scar to the base of the cliffs atop which the Banite fortress-temple sits. Although it is cleverly hidden behind a mass of thorny bushes, the tunnel Yorven’s group used to escape the temple is easy to find.

The tunnel runs nearly 2 miles underground, and it is roughly 15 feet wide and 10 feet high. It opens up into numerous wider caverns. The tunnel goes up at a steady incline, eventually ending in a trapdoor that opens into the upper level of Hallowgaunt into area F1.

When the characters enter the tunnels read the following:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud  
> From somewhere within comes a rhythmic thudding—slow, steady, and deep, as though the stone itself were breathing.  Every few heartbeats, a wave of pressure rolls outward, rattling the air.

## Hallowgaunt
The fortress-temple Hallowgaunt sits atop the soaring cliffs on the western edge of the Chaos Scar.

![[hallowgaunt.webp|right wtall]]

### Level 1: Fortress
The upper level of Hallowgaunt looks like any small military fortress befitting Bane. It has all the necessities to function on a day-to-day basis. Shoth-Gorag’s influence has not affected the soldiers and acolytes on this level to a great extent. The warriors here react to intruders with extreme hostility.

#### Features of the Fortress
All areas of the fortress share these features in common unless noted otherwise.

**Illumination:** Small windows near the ceiling provide bright light during the day. At night, torches in wall sconces provide bright illumination.
**Ceiling:** Ceilings are 15 feet high.
**Furniture:** Unless noted otherwise, furnishings are difficult terrain. Higher furnishings, such as tables, might require checks to move atop or be blocking terrain. Most furnishings can provide cover.
**Outer Wall:** This fortification is 15 feet high ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] DC 30 to climb), 3 feet thick, and constructed of massive blocks of granite.

#### Fortress Rooms
The upper level of Hallowgaunt figures prominently in Encounter 2 and Encounter 3. However, battle could spill into other areas. Below are brief descriptions of such areas. Unless noted otherwise, locks on this level require a DC 17 Thievery check to open or a DC 25 Athletics check to break.

**Kennel (F5):** Straw covers the earthen floor here, and two sets of shelves against the back wall hold a variety of leashes, combs, and other beast-care tools. The kennel master’s cot rests against the back wall with a locked chest underneath. Four large cages house the hounds at rest. Each cage is 10 feet long, 5 feet wide, 5 feet tall, and locked with a simple lock (Thievery DC 13 to open; Athletics DC 21 to break).

**Armory (F6):** The door to this area is locked with a stout padlock. Inside the room are numerous armor stands holding chainmail and leather armor, as well as cabinets filled with weapons and ammunition. A small, unlit forge is against the back wall.

**Mess Hall (F7):** This room holds three large tables each with six chairs. Against the east wall are a low serving table and a cabinet that holds plates, cups, and eating utensils.

**Captain’s Quarters (F8):** This room has a bed, a small altar to Bane, a small table, two chairs, numerous shelves, a locked cabinet, and two armor stands. The captain’s personal items are inside the cabinet.

**Kitchen (F9):** This cooking area has a high counter that runs the length of the north and east walls, as well as numerous cooking utensils, knives, pans, and other containers hanging from the walls. A larder in the southeast corner holds all manner of food.

### Level 2: Temple
This level once served as the main place of worship for the followers of Bane. However, the Banites here are completely under Shoth-Gorag’s sway, and they all bear the dread taint of the Far Realm. The temple contains a grand chapel, barracks, a prison and torture chamber, and a reliquary that houses Farbane. A number of Yorven’s compatriots languish in the prison. If freed, they might aid the characters.

#### Features of the Temple
All areas of the temple share these features unless noted otherwise.

**Illumination:** Torches in sconces create bright illumination.
**Ceiling:** The ceilings are 15 feet high.
**Walls:** The walls are tight-fitting granite bricks (Athletics DC 18 to climb). 

### Level 3: Shoth-Gorag’s Pit
This level consists of little more than a raised stone platform overlooking a vast natural cavern. Within a shallow depression in the cavern, the vast horror of Shoth-Gorag seethes and bubbles, its heart encased in an organic body that is a blasphemous melding of hundreds of unfortunate creatures. Above Shoth-Gorag, hanging in the air, is a portal to the Far Realm.

## Encounter 2: Latrine Duty
**Encounter Difficulty:**   
- [ ] Moderate (80 XP) Level 15
- [ ] Moderate (80 XP) Level 15

The tunnel up through the cliffs ends in an iron trapdoor that leads to one of the privies in the main barracks latrines (area F1).

When the characters reach area F1, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The end of the tunnel terminates in a set of iron rungs leading upward to an iron trapdoor. An unpleasant odor wafts into the tunnel from above. Beyond the trapdoor is a small privy. The latrine’s bench is behind you, and the privy door is shut before you.

The latrines are empty when the characters arrive.

When the party leaves the privy stall, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The privy opens up onto a large room that has stone floors. Seven privy stalls take up the north and west walls. A trio of bathing pools occupies middle of the room, and a set of wooden doors is set into the south wall.
> 
> Perception DC 33: Muffled voices can be heard beyond the southern doors.

The southern doors lead to area F2, but they’re closed, so the party’s arrival goes unnoticed. If the characters take any precautions to remain undetected, they surprise the Banites in area F2. The Banites are not expecting attackers to burst out of the latrines.

Indicated inhabitants represent the combined forces of areas F2 (northern barracks) and F3 (southern barracks).

When the adventurers reach area F2, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> This room is a military barracks. Four sets of bunk beds sit against the west wall, each with two trunks beneath the bottom bunk. Beyond the beds, the room contains a pair of tables, each with chairs, and a small altar to Bane in the northeast corner. Another set of double doors leads away to the south and a second, smaller door is set into the east wall. Seven heavily armed warriors reside here, all bearing the symbol of Bane on some piece of clothing or armor.
> 
> Perception DC 33: Barked orders and baying hounds can be heard beyond the smaller door.

The Banites attack immediately. Sounds of combat in area F2 are easily heard by the forces in the south barracks (area F3), who come running. The noise on the parade ground (area F4) prevents the Banites there from hearing any battle here soon enough to reinforce the barracks.

> [!warning]
> Four corrupt priests or soldiers of bane (level 13) represent a moderate encounter.  As the players wrap up area F2 give them one round to prepare for the reinforcements from F3 to arrive.

```encounter
name: My Enemy's Enemies
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 2: Corrupt Scout of Bane
- 1: Corrupt Priest of Bane
- 2: Corrupt Bane Hound
- 1: Yorven, 225, 35, 2
```

Setup
6 Banite soldiers (S)

### Features of the Area
**Altar:** This is a simple shrine dedicated to Bane. Bunks: These beds are 7 feet high and bolted to the floor. A ladder on the side of each bunk provides access to the top bed.
**Pools:** The bathing pools in the latrines are 2 feet deep and difficult terrain.
**Tables:** A creature can jump atop one of these oak tables as part of a move action ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] DC 34).

## Encounter 3: Parade Ground

Setup
1 Banite captain (C)
1 kennel master (K)
2 war hounds (W)
3 Banite soldiers (S)
4 Banite bolters (B)

To reach the stairwell that leads down to the second level of Hallowgaunt, the adventurers must brave the parade ground and defeat the rest of the Banite defenders. Alain, the Banite captain who commands the first level of the fortress, has heard the combat in the barracks, and he marshals what remains of his forces. 

When the adventurers exit the barracks, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A U-shaped stone building encloses a large parade ground, which has an earthen surface worn flat and hard. In the center of the parade ground is a walled staircase leading down into darkness. Across the area are three other doors. To the north are two more doorways, one a steel door and the second an open entryway into straw-covered area. A set of massive wooden gates reinforced with bands of steel closes the parade ground in on the south. Just inside the gates are two raised platforms, each rising high enough to allow those on them a view over the fortress walls. Beyond the wall, a cliff side soars up and disappears into the mist. 

Alain has positioned his forces around the parade ground to best deal with invaders. 

When the adventurers see the Banites, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Across from you stands a tall human warrior in black plate armor with red trim, a glittering bastard sword in his hand. Other soldiers stand beside him. Nearby, a muscular human in leather armor stands behind two massive war hounds, each straining against its leash. On the raised platforms, four humans armed with crossbows take aim at you.

### Tactics
When combat begins, Alain and his soldiers charge the adventurers. The kennel master uses sic ’em to push the war hounds into melee combat. Bolters on the raised platforms fire their crossbows.

As the battle progresses, Alain and his soldiers team up with allies, trying to gain an increase in damage and combat advantage. Alain uses rally point to allow his allies to reposition themselves tactically to these ends. 

### Features of the Area
**Platforms:** These simple platforms are 15 feet from the ground. Each has a ladder nailed to it, allowing access to the top.
**Walled Staircase:** This staircase’s wall is 5 feet high. It can provide cover. The stairs are steep enough to be difficult terrain. They lead down to Encounter 4.

### Conclusion
Alain has the key to the armory, the key to the cabinet in his room, and a skeleton key that unlocks the kennel cages. On the kennel master’s belt is a skeleton key that opens the kennel cages, as well as a key to the chest under his cot.

## Encounter 4: Profane Chapel
When the adventurers descend, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Stairs from the parade ground lead down steeply, terminating in a short hall lit by torches in sconces. A great set of doors, each carved from a solid piece of ebony, blocks further progress. The black hand of Bane is deeply etched on a red field in the center of each door. Cold dread rises in you as you consider opening those doors.

Beyond the double doors dwells the former high priest of Bane and current high priest of Shoth-Gorag, Garvan, alongside foulspawn created from other Banites. Garvan is unaware of the battle on the upper level. The foulspawn seer, however, is aware of some kind of disturbance above, so the seer is keeping an eye on the chapel doors.

Adventurers need to succeed on a DC 19 group Stealth check to surprise the monsters beyond the doors. If half or more of the characters succeed on the check, the party receives a surprise round.

Setup
Garvan, High Priest of Shoth-Gorag (G)
1 foulspawn seer (S)
2 foulspawn hulks (H)

When the adventurers enter the chapel, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The great double doors open onto a dimly lit chapel. Twisting columns line the east and west walls and a great altar flanked by a pair of statues stands against the north wall. The statues were once of Bane, but the likeness of the grim, militant god has been replaced by a tentacled, alien visage. In front of the altar and statues, in the center of the chapel, short stairways lead down to a black basalt slab fitted with manacles. Old bloodstains are visible on the floor near the slab. Sets of double doors on either side of the chapel lead off to the east and west.
> 
> Four horrific monsters stand within the chapel. One is a blubbery humanoid with a bone staff, and two others look like fanged giants without skin. The fourth is a bearded, deformed human who wears remnants of chainmail and a symbol of Bane. His armor is torn open to allow his two tentacles to move freely.

### Tactics
When combat begins, the foulspawn hulks charge forward to engage the adventurers in melee. Garvan follows them, but the foulspawn seer remains behind the basalt slab. Garvan opens with mind-bending whispers, then uses compelling whispers to slide foes away from him and closer to the hulks. The foulspawn seer begins combat with distortion blast but tries to avoid hitting the hulks with the attack.

In later rounds, the foulspawn seer uses warp orb while keeping as many allies as possible in its foul insight aura. It avoids melee combat unless cornered. Garvan moves toward ranged attackers and uses grasping tentacles to pull those enemies within range of his or the hulk’s melee attacks.

The foulspawn fight to the death. If all of the foulspawn are slain and he is bloodied, Garvan retreats to the barracks (see Encounter 5).

### Features of the Area
**Altar:** The altar is 8 feet long, 2 feet high, 2 feet deep. It is difficult terrain, and it is suffused with Far Realm energy (Arcana DC 18 to detect). Behind the altar is a locked secret door that leads to the pit of Shoth-Gorag (see Encounter 8). The altar can roll to the side when the secret door behind it opens, allowing easier access to the open passage. 

A character can ascertain that the altar can roll to one side with a successful DC 18 Perception check. Finding the secret door and its opening lever then requires another successful DC 18 Perception check. If the characters fail the first check, finding the secret door and lever requires a successful DC 26 Perception check.

Once the lever is pulled, the altar rolls to the right and the secret door swings open on hidden hinges. However, moving the altar also triggers a trap ShothGorag and Garvan placed. Only they know about the trap and can activate the mechanism safely.

The door closes and the altar returns to its normal position after 3 rounds unless one or both are somehow prevented from doing so. A hidden switch in the passage beyond the secret door (DC 18 Perception check to find) allows one to open and close the secret door from inside, which does not trigger the trap.

Far Transport Level 10 Minion Trap

Immune attacks
Triggered Actions
Attack (psychic, teleportation) F At-Will
Trigger: A creature other than Garvan or Shoth-Gorag uses the lever to open the secret door.
Effect (No Action): Close burst 5 (creatures in the burst); 5 psychic damage, and the target is teleported to the torture chamber (see Encounter 7).
Countermeasures
Unlock: Thievery DC 26. Success: The character opens the secret door without using the lever. Failure (21 or lower): The trap triggers.
Suppress: Arcana DC 26. Success: The character suppresses the magical energy on the altar so that the trap doesn’t trigger when the secret door is opened. Failure (21 or lower): The trap triggers.

**Pillars:** A pillar can provide cover.
**Pit with Basalt Slab:** The pit is 5 feet deep. The basalt slab in the middle of it is 3 feet wide, 10 feet long, and 3 feet tall. It is difficult terrain.
**Statues:** These figures are blocking terrain.

### Conclusion
Barracks Soldiers: If the characters take more than 10 minutes to reach Encounter 5, the barracks occupants might come looking for intruders. These creatures spend a few moments investigating any carnage the characters leave Behind before moving on to find the invaders. They might show up just after the characters finish a short rest in another area.

## Encounter 5: Temple Barracks
Setup
1 tainted warpriest (T)
2 tainted scouts (S)
2 foulspawn berserkers (B)

This barracks houses guards and their leader, a tainted warpriest named Dasharr. Although the walls are thick in the temple, the scouts here heard the battle in the chapel and made ready for intruders. Monster locations on the map reflects this awareness.

When the adventurers can see the room, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> This barracks contains four beds, a large table and chairs, various cabinets for storage, and a number of armor stands and weapon racks.
> 
> Standing in the middle of the room is a figure in red chainmail, a mace clenched in his hands. His face is covered in tiny tentacles like writhing worms, and his eyes are black. Flanking this creature are two bulky humanoids, who heft their greatswords and gurgle in anticipation. Each has gray skin, massive muscles, beady glowing eyes, and a fanged maw.
> 
> All three warriors wear the symbol of Bane.

When the scouts emerge, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A pair of humans in leather armor and armed with short swords rush into the room. They also bear strange deformities and wear the symbol of Bane.

### Tactics
The berserkers begin their assault with berserker charge. The warpriest Dasharr opens with force tremor, then favors melee combat. If need be, the scouts delay so they can enter the fray after the party is engaged. They favor rear-rank targets and those whom they can flank.

As the battle progresses, the berserkers and scouts move about the battlefield, attempting to flank foes. The berserkers continue to charge, risking opportunity attacks if necessary.

Creatures here fight to the death.

### Features of the Area
The warpriest’s personal quarters and a small latrine are accessible through a door in the east wall and the north wall, respectively.

**Cabinets:** The lockers in the southeast corner of the main room are unlocked and contain personal items. A cabinet in Dasharr’s room is locked (Thievery DC 17 to open; Athletics DC 25 to break). It contains his personal effects.
**Pools:** The bathing pool in the latrine is 2 feet deep and difficult terrain.
**Tables:** A creature can jump atop one of these oak tables as part of a move action (Athletics DC 18).

### Conclusion
Dasharr carries the key to the armory on the upper level, as well as the key to his storage cabinet.

## Encounter 6: Reliquary
Setup
1 giant object mimic (O)
7 giant mimic whelps (M)

This room houses texts and items sacred to Bane. Most items stored here are of esoteric value. However, the reliquary’s most recent addition is a potent Banite warhammer named Farbane and its guardians, the giant object mimic Ithgok and its spawn.

When the adventurers can see the room, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A tremendous slab of basalt dominates the center of this wide chamber, and upon the slab rests a glowing warhammer of violet metal. Arranged about the slab are several wooden tables displaying various relics and icons. Lining the east and west walls are shelves packed with tomes, candles, and other religious items. Against the far wall stand five heavy wooden cabinets.
> 
> Perception DC 29: One of the nearby tables wiggles—it’s some sort of creature.

When the mimics attack, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The great basalt block writhes, its surface taking on the appearance of wet, gray clay. A wide maw opens in the block, and tentacles sprout from it. Around the room, other smaller furnishings undergo a similar transformation.

The mimics prefer to surprise intruders, but they attack if one or more of them is discovered. See the Tactics section.

### Tactics
If possible, Ithgok waits for several adventurers to move within range of its crushing tendrils before it and its whelps attack. If Farbane is still resting atop Ithgok when the mimics attack, Ithgok swallows the hammer as a minor action before attacking (see below for what happens later).

As the battle progresses, Ithgok uses crushing tendrils when it has fewer than two enemies in its clutches. The mimic whelps focus their attacks on grabbed targets.

If Ithgok is reduced to 50 hit points or fewer, it disgorges Farbane and uses shapeshift to return to its object form. The whelps follow suit, returning to object form. Ithgok hopes the adventurers take the hammer and leave it be. If the adventurers press the attack, Ithgok and its spawn fight to the death.

### Features of the Area
**Book Shelves:** The shelves lining the east and west walls in this area are 8 feet high and can be climbed (Athletics DC 13). They contain sacred texts that are worth little except to followers of Bane.Cabinets: These four walk-in cabinets are each 5 feet deep and 8 feet high. They can be climbed (Athletics DC 13). Each contains items used in the worship of Bane.

Treasure: Farbane.
Farbane Level 14 Rare
This stout hammer is forged, head to haft, of a strange violet metal. The symbol of Bane adorns the head and pommel, and the haft is wrapped in mottled leather.

## Encounter 7: Torture Chamber
Setup
1 foulspawn warpcaller (W)
2 foulspawn grues (G)
2 foulspawn berserkers (B)

This room serves as a jail and torture chamber. Monsters here are intent on their task, so they fail to notice battle elsewhere in the temple. However, the adventurers still need to succeed on a DC 19 group Stealth check to surprise the monsters. If half or more of the characters succeed on the check, the characters receive a surprise round.

The trap in Encounter 4 might teleport the adventurers into the cells here. If the party teleports in, the foulspawn still attack. They use their powers to teleport weak-looking foes into the open room, leaving tough-looking opponents behind bars.

If the characters enter through the doors, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Racks along the walls here hold various instruments of torture. A wooden table fitted with straps and manacles sits in the center of the room, and behind it is a pair of prison cells with doors of iron bars. Each cell contains two wounded humans. A dark hole opens in the floor near the south wall.

If the characters teleport in, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> You arrive inside prison cells that have doors of iron bars. Each cell contains two wounded humans. Outside the cells, racks along the walls hold various instruments of torture. A wooden table fitted with straps and manacles sits in the center of the room. A dark hole opens in the floor near the south wall.

In either case, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Squatting atop the wooden table are two stunted humanoids with sharp claws and maniacal grins. Guarding the cells are two massively muscled gray humanoids that wield greatswords and wear tattered tabards with Bane’s symbol on them. A blubbery humanoid that has rippling skin and a musical pipe in hand sits near the hole.

### Tactics
The warpcaller and grues focus on ranged attackers. Grues use mind worm to weaken a foe’s Will before assailing it with whispers of madness. When cornered or flanked, they escape via teleport. The warpcaller uses its teleportation powers to keep enemies away from it and the grues but near the berserkers. When it uses warpmind field, the warpcaller places the origin square so the zone forces foes out of the hallway or affects the largest number of enemies in the room. 

Berserkers charge into melee. They willingly take great risks to defend the grues and warpcaller.

#### Banites
If freed during the combat, the Banite soldiers are willing to fight if asked to do so. Use the Banite soldier statistics (page 9) but reduce damage by 3 if the soldier is unarmed. Allow the players to control the soldiers’ actions, stepping in only if the chosen action is suicidal for the soldier. 

Unless the Banites join the battle, when targeting their powers, the foulspawn do not consider the Banite prisoners to be enemies.

### Features of the Area
**Cells:** Each cell has doors of 1-inch-thick iron bars. The bars are spaced 6 inches apart, providing cover if the bars are between an attacker and its target. The doors are locked (Thievery DC 18 to open; Athletics DC 31 to break).
**Hole:** This opening in the floor descends in a decline down to Shoth-Gorag’s lair about 50 feet below. It is wide enough to accommodate a crawling Medium creature, but it is slimy with old gore.
**Racks:** These wooden racks contain instruments of torture. The various blades, pokers, and hooks function as daggers or clubs in combat, but they are enough to arm the Banite soldiers.
**Table:** This blood-spattered torture table is bolted to the floor. A creature can jump atop the table as part of a move action (Athletics DC 18).

### Prisoners
Despite their wickedness and loyalty to Bane, these captives are grateful to be rescued. However, they do not completely trust the adventurers. Roleplay the scene as the characters interact with the Banites, perhaps including some of the optional skill checks shown below. Each time the characters make a good case or succeed on an optional check, they gain a new piece of information from the Banites.

**Diplomacy (DC 13):** The character reassures the Banites that they and the party share a common goal.

**Dungeoneering (DC 18):** The character uses knowledge of the Far Realm to drive home the danger that Shoth-Gorag represents.

**Heal (DC 13):** The character eases the Banites’ pain and tends their wounds, deepening their gratefulness to the party.

**Intimidate (DC 18):** The character threatens the Banites or leverages their fear of Shoth-Gorag.

**Religion (DC 13):** The character uses an understanding of Bane’s tenets to influence the Banites into assisting those whom Yorven believed to be sent by the deity.

#### Information Gains
The Banites are willing to help their liberators with information. They know the following facts:

- A secret door is hidden behind the altar in the main chapel. The door has a magical trap, but the Banites don’t know the trap’s function. They know that Shoth-Gorag dwells beyond the secret door, but they know nothing about the layout of the pit. With this information, characters can easily find the secret door, and they gain a +4 bonus to checks to find and disable the trap.
- Farbane is in the reliquary, and a terrible gigantic creature and its spawn guard the weapon. These creatures can take the shape of objects. The DC to see the mimics for what they are lowers to 20 for the characters.
- The hole in this room is a chute to an unknown location. When a prisoner became too incoherent to merit further suffering, the foulspawn threw the unfortunate down the chute. The soldiers here are all that remain of about a dozen loyal Banites.
- The Banites might know where other treasures you have placed are hidden in the fortress.

#### Unlikely Allies
It’s up to you whether the Banites can be persuaded to join the characters in the battle against other enemies here. They are inclined to leave the fortress and unwilling to do further battle without arms and armor. Any soldiers allowed to leave make for the surface and escape. If they learn that Yorven has gone to Restwell Keep, they join him there.

### Conclusion
Each foulspawn grue has a key to one cell. The warpcaller has the key to both cells.

## Encounter 8: The Thing That Should Not Be
Setup
Shoth-Gorag (G)
1 creeping spawn (C)
1 reaching spawn (R)
1 slithering spawn (S)

If the adventurers brave the chute that leads from the torture chamber, see Features of the Area and describe their entrance as you see fit.

Otherwise, when the adventurers enter, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A long stairway leads to a short hall that ends at a stone platform overlooking a great cavern. Stone stairs lead down to the cavern floor, which has a few shallow crevices in it. A blue glow emanates from a rift suspended in the air above the cavern’s center.
> 
> A writhing mass of tentacles, appendages, eyes, and mouths is connected to the rift. The mass fills the cavern with the deafening shriek of a thousand raving voices and sends out questing tentacles in your direction.
> 
> Foul creatures, mostly fleshy tentacles and fanged maws with hints of other creatures mixed in, writhe and wriggle near the huge mass. They also screech and begin to slither toward you.

Shoth-Gorag and its spawn attack immediately.

When Shoth-Gorag uses create spawn for the first time, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> One side of the huge mass bursts open in a spray of fluid. From this dripping wound, a wretched abomination of tentacles and fanged maws slithers free.

### Tactics
Shoth-Gorag grabs foes, and it uses threatening reach to discourage enemy movement. The creature rarely moves unless it needs to reach a ranged attacker. It instead prefers to use create spawn to replenish destroyed minions, and then trade a move action for a minor to use dissolving tentacles on those it is grabbing. If it has to choose, Shoth-Gorag favors create spawn.

Shoth-Gorag’s spawn focus on those their master isn’t currently grabbing. They direct their attacks especially at enemies that use ranged attacks, and they work together to gain combat advantage and to herd foes toward Shoth-Gorag. When Shoth-Gorag dies, all its spawn are immediately destroyed.

### Features of the Area
**Illumination:** The rift dimly lights this area.
**Ceiling:** The ceiling is 30 feet high.
**Chute (X):** This tunnel from the prison enters the pit here, 30 feet from the cavern floor. One Small or Medium creature can lurk in this narrow opening, but is prone and blocks line of sight for those farther inside the chute while doing so.
**Crevices:** These fissures are difficult terrain.
**Platform:** This raised area is 10 feet above the cavern floor (Athletics DC 18 to climb).
**Stairs:** The stairway from the platform to the cavern floor is difficult terrain to a creature ascending them. Stairs up to Level 2 are difficult terrain.
**Rift:** This opening to the Far Realm occupies a square 15 feet above the floor. When Shoth-Gorag dies, any creature that ends its turn within 15 feet of the rift is pulled 5 feet upward toward the rift. A creature pulled adjacent to the rift tumbles into the Far Realm and is destroyed. A character holding Farbane feels the rift’s pull but moves only if willing to do so.

### Conclusion
When Shoth-Gorag drops to 0 hit points, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The unearthly monstrosity shrieks, and its flesh dissolves into putrescent slime. Its spawn quickly liquefy into pools of disgusting ichor. Left behind is a chunk of black stone, roughly 3 feet in diameter, that pulses with a fell blue radiance. The blue rift in space still flickers menacingly.

Shoth-Gorag’s heart weighs 450 pounds and is all that remains of the meteor that fell centuries ago and carved the Chaos Scar. A DC 18 Dungeoneering check reveals that Shoth-Gorag can eventually regrow its body unless its heart is destroyed.

To ensure that Shoth-Gorag never does so, the adventurers must use Farbane to strike the heart and destroy it. When the characters do so, proceed with 

## Encounter 9: Flee!
When Farbane strikes the heart, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Shoth-Gorag’s heart shatters into powder. Above, the blue rift in reality winks out. A deep rumble shakes the cavern. Massive chunks of stone begin to fall from the ceiling as the ground buckles with terrible energy.

Destroying the heart abruptly closes the rift to the Far Realm, releasing anyone suspended in the air and unleashing a tremendous amount of energy. This energy sets off a series of earthquakes that begins to bring the entire complex crashing down. 

Characters have only a few minutes to escape the destruction of Hallowgaunt. The entire fortress is collapsing. To represent the desperate flight from the fortress, you can run the following skill challenge.

### Escape Hallowgaunt
The characters are immediately aware that Hallowgaunt is collapsing around them. They have to escape or risk being crushed under the falling fortress.

Level: 10 (2,500 XP).

**Complexity:** Special (12 successful group Endurance checks before 20 rounds expire)

**Time:** Each group Endurance check represents 1 round of progress, and each secondary check is a standard action. Adventurers have 20 rounds before the fortress crashes down. The countdown begins at the start of the initiative count on the round after the adventurers destroy the heart of Shoth-Gorag.

**Primary Checks:** This skill challenge uses a group DC 18 Endurance check as the primary check. All the characters push their bodies to the limit in their mad flight. If at least half the characters in the party succeed on the group check, the party earns one success in the skill challenge.

**Secondary Checks:** Once before each group Endurance check, each character can use a secondary skill to attempt a DC 18 check. A successful check with a secondary skill grants each character a +1 bonus to the group Endurance check. Secondary Skills include Acrobatics, Arcana, Athletics, Dungeoneering, Nature, Perception, and any other skill for which a player can make a creative case. Use these checks to help weave a narrative of the escape.

*Acrobatics:* The character dodges through narrowing gaps last, allowing others to move ahead first.

*Arcana (trained only):* The character channels the violently dispersing magical energy to slow the tremors’ nearby effects.

*Athletics:* The character climbs, jumps, or forces past obstacles quickly, helping others advance. The character might force open the outer gates of Hallowgaunt as a final check.

*Dungeoneering:* The character spots weaknesses in the passages, helping the party avoid poor paths.Nature (primal power source required; trained only):With the help of primal earth spirits, the character stabilizes the nearby ground, giving the party a little more time.

*Perception:* The character sees the clearest way through the debris and falling dust.

**Splitting Up:** If any character decides to spend a standard action healing a fallen comrade, searching for treasure, or performing some other task that doesn’t directly aid in the party’s escape, the whole group that character is with loses 1 round. This fact is readily apparent to the characters and, by extension, the players. 

The party can split up, leaving behind those who tarry. Each time this happens, the character or characters left behind become a separate group, and the new group’s successes are tracked separately from then on.

#### Success
If a fleeing group accumulates 12 successes before the 20 rounds have expired, the group escapes the crumbling fortress with only superficial injuries.

If a group escapes, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Your mad flight through the fortress has brought you safely beyond the walls of Hallowgaunt. Moments after you make it clear, the citadel crumbles downward in a massive implosion of dust and rock.

#### Failure
Characters in a group that fails the skill challenge do not escape the collapsing fortress in time. Each adventurer in a group that fails takes damage equal to his or her bloodied value plus 3d10 damage. Use this damage and the number of successes the group accumulated to help you decide in what conditions the adventurers find themselves after the collapse.

For example, a character who is knocked unconscious could be trapped under fallen debris and require rescue. A group that had 8 or more successes might be on the surface but inside Hallowgaunt’s walls when the citadel implodes. Such a group is close enough to the surface to escape after the fall. A group with fewer than 8 successes might instead be entombed in some corner of the fortress and left to search for another way out. Perhaps they fall all the way into the caverns below Hallowgaunt, with no choice but to explore until they reach an exit.
