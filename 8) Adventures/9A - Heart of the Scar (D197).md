# Background
The Far Realm is home to countless alien abominations, some of which rival the mightiest gods in power. Occasionally, these great entities clash over motives and machinations far beyond the ken of mortal minds. Rarer still, one of these terrible beings is defeated, stripped of its power, and hurled into the dark cosmos to wander the void for eternity. 

Such was the fate of the entity known as Shoth-Gorag. However, Shoth-Gorag had made inroads into the world of mortals, attracting the attention of warlocks and mad cultists. Banished from its domain in the Far Realm, Shoth-Gorag used what remained of its power to pass into the mortal world, in hopes that it might go unnoticed and slowly rebuild its strength. 

Shoth-Gorag’s physical form had been destroyed, and all that remained of the malign entity was its heart, a calcified chunk of unspeakable evil. This rock shot across the cosmos and impacted the world centuries ago, carving out what is now called the Chaos Scar. After the heart fell, a group of Banites discovered it. Mistaking the heart for a gift from their tyrannical deity, they took it. Around it, high on the cliffs above the Chaos Scar, they built a small fortress temple they named Hallowgaunt. 

The heart of Shoth-Gorag became the center of worship for the Banites. From their temple, the heart began to exert its influence, inundating the surrounding area with its evil. Its presence acted as clarion call to wicked creatures, and such monsters began to come to the Chaos Scar in great numbers. Over the years, Shoth-Gorag has fed on the constant violence and turmoil in the valley. 

Shoth-Gorag has also been poisoning the minds of the Banites in Hallowgaunt. Banite clerics there draw some of their strength directly from Shoth-Gorag. Its influence has also begun to twist the bodies of these misguided servitors, and some of them have bizarre deformities indicative of exposure to the Far Realm’s energy. These Banites have come to call themselves the Brotherhood of the Scar. 

While gaining mastery over Hallowgaunt, Shoth-Gorag has also amassed enough power to begin the final phase of its plans. It is undergoing a hideous resurgence, building a physical body worthy of a Far Realm lord. To build this physical form, Shoth-Gorag requires ample supplies of flesh. It has been sending out its most trusted servants, members of the Brotherhood of the Scar, to capture creatures great and small. Any unfortunates these Banites capture are dragged back to Hallowgaunt to be tortured out of their wits and cast down to where Shoth-Gorag dwells deep under the fortress. 

Shoth-Gorag absorbs those brought to it, using their flesh as raw material to construct a horrific body around its heart. Soon, Shoth-Gorag will be powerful enough to move beyond the temple of Bane and begin absorbing the myriad creatures dwelling in the Chaos Scar. Their evil, insanity, and flesh will become its own, until nothing remains except Shoth-Gorag and its truest servants. 

Although Shoth-Gorag now controls a majority of the priests and soldiers serving in Hallowgaunt, a small group of temple guards loyal to Bane resisted the Far Realm lord’s growing influence. These faithful Banites surreptitiously sought aid from their allies outside the Chaos Scar, seeking is a means to destroy Shoth-Gorag and return the temple to Bane. 

Another temple sent a potent relic to its allies in the Chaos Scar. This item, a powerful warhammer called Farbane, was crafted to destroy interlopers from the Far Realm. Shortly after the hammer arrived, however, Shoth-Gorag became aware of the insurrection. Shoth-Gorag’s loyalists attacked the rebellious Banites and seized Farbane. Most of Bane’s true servants were slain or captured for torture. Shoth-Gorag then called forth a potent aberrant guardian for Hallowgaunt’s reliquary, where Farbane is now stored. 

A fraction of the faithful Banites managed to escape Shoth-Gorag’s purging. Most perished during their escape or while crossing the Chaos Scar with the Brotherhood of the Scar in pursuit. However, one made it to the King’s Wall. This surviving Banite, a human named Yorven, hopes to find allies powerful enough to end Shoth-Gorag’s growing threat.
