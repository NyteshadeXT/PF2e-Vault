# Background
Four hundred years ago, a meteor collided with the world and left a nasty gash across the face of the Nentir Vale. Unbeknownst to anyone, the meteor also carried a passenger. An ancient beholder thought that it could hitch a ride on the meteor and touch down on a new world ripe for conquest. To survive the long journey, the beholder wrapped itself in a protective coating of crystal (using a unique version of the Stasis Shell ritual, presented in Dragon 366) and rode the meteor through the depths of space. 

Unfortunately for the beholder, a fragment of its crystal shell broke off as the meteor entered the atmosphere. The fragment struck a young man named Keljack, scarring him. Because the beholder’s shell was now not complete, the creature was unable to break free of its crystal prison. It lies in wait for the day when the shard that is part of Keljack is reunited with the rest of the crystal shell. 

In the meantime, destiny has not been kind to Keljack. Although the crystal fragment gifted Keljack with great longevity, his life has been filled with hardship and misfortune because of the disfigurement. That’s about to change. 

Now a well-known outlaw, Keljack recently discovered that his body is infused with energy similar to that coming from a particular area of the Chaos Scar. He traveled to the outskirts of the Scar and tried to pinpoint the source of the energy. Though he could feel the location of the stasis crystal dimly, he knew the Scar was too dangerous for him to venture any farther into it by himself. As he returned from this journey back to the Nentir Vale, he rescued an ogre named Fool from a pack of mutated beasts, and the two became fast friends. 

Keljack has resolved to undertake an expedition deeper into the Scar, and to attract hirelings he has spread word of a grand treasure hunt. He and Fool are going to meet with a pair of notable bandit leaders and decide which of those groups best suits their needs.
