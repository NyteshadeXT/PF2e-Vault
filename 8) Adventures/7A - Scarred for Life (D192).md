# Background
Four hundred years ago, a meteor collided with the world and left a nasty gash across the face of the Nentir Vale. Unbeknownst to anyone, the meteor also carried a passenger. An ancient beholder thought that it could hitch a ride on the meteor and touch down on a new world ripe for conquest. To survive the long journey, the beholder wrapped itself in a protective coating of crystal (using a unique version of the Stasis Shell ritual, presented in Dragon 366) and rode the meteor through the depths of space. 

Unfortunately for the beholder, a fragment of its crystal shell broke off as the meteor entered the atmosphere. The fragment struck a young man named Keljack, scarring him. Because the beholder’s shell was now not complete, the creature was unable to break free of its crystal prison. It lies in wait for the day when the shard that is part of Keljack is reunited with the rest of the crystal shell. 

In the meantime, destiny has not been kind to Keljack. Although the crystal fragment gifted Keljack with great longevity, his life has been filled with hardship and misfortune because of the disfigurement. That’s about to change. 

Now a well-known outlaw, Keljack recently discovered that his body is infused with energy similar to that coming from a particular area of the Chaos Scar. He traveled to the outskirts of the Scar and tried to pinpoint the source of the energy. Though he could feel the location of the stasis crystal dimly, he knew the Scar was too dangerous for him to venture any farther into it by himself. As he returned from this journey back to the Nentir Vale, he rescued an ogre named Fool from a pack of mutated beasts, and the two became fast friends. 

Keljack has resolved to undertake an expedition deeper into the Scar, and to attract hirelings he has spread word of a grand treasure hunt. He and Fool are going to meet with a pair of notable bandit leaders and decide which of those groups best suits their needs.

# Running the Adventure
When the adventure starts, the heroes find them selves in one of two situations.

**Meeting the Blades** Some inexperienced adventurers calling themselves Bathram’s Blades are at the Slumbering Giant in Restwell Keep celebrating their return from their first expedition into the Chaos Scar. Between drunken tales of their exploits, the Blades talk about the close call they had with the outlaw Keljack and his new ogre sidekick, Fool. The two were seen on the southern edge of the King’s Wall about a week ago as the Blades traveled away from the Scar, and they might still be in the area. 

The Blades can impart any of the commonly held beliefs about Keljack (see below) if any character makes a successful DC 28 [[skills#Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] check.

**Job Board Posting** Wanted for Murder, Robbery, Assault and other crimes: Keljack and his ogre companion. Lord Criswell offers 150 gold for his head and 30 for the ogre. 

[[Lord Drysdale]] has wanted posters posted for [[Keljack]] and [[Fool]] on the Restwell job board. Capturing Keljack would be a triumph for his political career, for the peace of the Nentir Vale, and for justice. He knows that going after Keljack personally would be foolhardy, especially since the outlaw has been seen with an ogre recently. But he’s pretty sure that raising the bounty on both of those outlaws will attract the talent needed to bring them in.  The accusations leveled at Keljack are largely true, though perhaps embellished by the passage of time. The accusations against Fool are entirely fabricated, but to the Lord Warden, they seem like crimes an ogre would commit.

**Keljack**
By the order of the Lord Protector Drysdale, the outlaw Keljack—known for the prominent and distinctive scar across his face, and being of moderate height and surly disposition—is wanted alive! He has pillaged, murdered, and committed a sundry host of villainous shenanigans too numerous to list. Any who deliver Keljack alive to Fallcrest will be paid the sum of 1,500 gold pieces.

**Fool**
By the order of the Lord Protector Drysdale, an ogre calling himself Fool, known to wield a morningstar and a handaxe, and also known to travel in the company of Keljack the outlaw, is wanted alive! He has committed murder, destroyed property, and stolen sheep. Any who deliver this ogre alive to Fallcrest will receive the sum of 300 gold pieces.

## Keljack
Keljack is well known throughout the lands surrounding the Chaos Scar. Bandit leader, outlaw, mercenary—Keljack has been all of these things and more.

Bards say he was birthed from the egg of a red dragon, yet appears human. The scar that mars his face grants him immense power, they say. Unequaled in skill with a longsword, he never draws first and never attacks without warning. Many people consider Keljack a celebrity, even as they fear his presence. He is a man whom people love to hate, even if his reputation far surpasses his actual abilities.

The truth is far less colorful. Keljack, born Kellem Jackson, was a teenager when the meteor that caused the Chaos Scar passed overhead. A fragment of the beholder’s stasis shell broke off as the meteor entered the atmosphere, and that sliver struck Kellem in the face. He survived, but the fragment transferred its magic into Kellem’s body and left him bearing a large, vivid scar. Those who looked upon him immediately afterward saw his disfigurement, coinciding as it did with the meteor’s arrival, as an ill omen, and he was ostracized.

Bitter and angry, Kellem resolved that if people were going to curse his name, they would do so because of his deeds and not because of his disfigurement. He stole his father’s longsword, joined a local bandit gang, and never looked back. Wanting no connection with the hapless farmer he had once been, he changed his name to Keljack and embarked on a career of banditry and terror.

For reasons Keljack doesn’t understand, he suffers periodic bouts of madness. When he comes to his senses, his body is rejuvenated and revitalized, but his skills are rusty from disuse. What he doesn’t realize is that the magic of the shard that struck him is keeping him from aging, but at the same time that sliver is tainted by its connection to the beholder—it imbues Keljack with a healthy dose of the beholder’s own insanity and paranoia. As the shard keeps him young, it also regularly drives him insane.

During his periods of lucidity, Keljack returns to and remains in the region. He has found that the farther removed he is from the Chaos Scar, the more easily he can stave off the madness. Even so, the bouts of insanity are lasting longer and longer, and he wonders if the day might come when he never regains his senses.

Recently, Keljack ambushed a wandering scholar in search of loot. The woman had no valuables, but she escaped with her life and health by telling the outlaw something he had never heard before: Magic emanated from Keljack, and it was similar to the energy that her fellow scholars had detected deep within the southern forest of the Chaos Scar.

Keljack suspected this energy was related to his madness, so he traveled to the Scar to find the truth. Even though he sensed the stasis crystal somewhere ahead of him, he realized that he was no match for the monsters of the Scar and turned back. On his way out, he saved the life of the ogre named Fool, and the two quickly became friends. 

Now, Keljack and Fool look to meet with prospective hirelings. Keljack feels that another bout of insanity is fast approaching, and this upcoming expedition could be his last chance to find out the truth about himself before he loses his mind once more.

[[Keljack]]

## Fool
This ogre is exceptionally intelligent. As he grew to adulthood and realized how different he was from the other ogres in his tribe, he decided to conceal his intelligence and act the part of a dimwit. Some time ago, his tribe came under the dominion of a red dragon named Maluriath, who had been corrupted by the chaotic energy of a Deck of Many Things. The dragon named the ogres after the various cards in the deck, and this particular ogre was dubbed “Fool.”

Unlike the other ogres, Fool was smart enough to see that the dragon cared not for the tribe but only for itself. Determined to get his tribe out from under the dragon’s rule, he escaped and set out looking for help. As he reached the fringe of the Chaos Scar, he was attacked by monsters that threatened to end his quest before it could begin. Keljack was nearby when this assault occurred, and he helped Fool dispatch the monsters.

When Keljack saved Fool’s life, Fool couldn’t believe his good fortune. Though his tribe hails from deep within the Chaos Scar, Fool had heard stories of Keljack from travelers over the years. If anyone could defeat the dragon and free his people, it would be this man. He agreed to help Keljack solve the mystery of his scar and Keljack, in turn, agreed to help him vanquish the dragon afterward.

Fool is in no way a stereotypical ogre. Smart, analytical, and difficult to anger, he tries to plan for every contingency. He maintains a “dumb ogre” facade, even away from his tribe, when dealing with those he doesn’t know. Never very social, Fool has found in Keljack something he never expected when he fled his tribe: a friend

[[Fool]]

## The Beholder
At first, the beholder railed against its imprisonment. The stasis shell that kept it alive during its journey on the meteor now keeps it trapped until the missing shard can be reunited with the rest of the crystal. Through years of experimentation, the beholder figured out how to extend a small amount of its power beyond the crystal’s confines. Unwilling to become a curio in some wizard’s tower, the beholder dominated monsters and explorers that uncovered its resting place, and it used those captive creatures to ward off other snoopers. Its latest conquest is a small pack of gnolls.

The beholder sensed when Keljack neared the Scar on his first expedition, and along the connection between itself and Keljack, it was able to perceive an image of the outlaw. Now most of its gnolls roam the Scar under specific orders to capture Keljack and bring him to the crystal.

> [!infobox]
> # Dead or Alive
> If the adventurers capture Keljack and Fool, the two outlaws do their best to convince the adventurers to help them solve the mystery of Keljack’s scar. Keljack lies, persuades, and makes outlandish promises if he thinks it will do him any good; he has about 1,000 gp hidden in various locations around the Nentir Vale, though he’d rather not give it all up at once. 
> <br>
> Fool, for his part, talks of his enslaved tribe and argues cogently (dropping, whenever convenient, the “dumb ogre” act) for his and Keljack’s release. 
> <br>
> If the heroes insist on holding the outlaws captive, Fool’s ability to get out of certain kinds of restraining effects could come into play. If Keljack and the ogre manage to win free, the adventure continues just as it would have if the outlaws had escaped the inn. 
> <br>
> If the adventurers are determined and skilled enough to keep Keljack and Fool under arrest, later to be hanged for their crimes, it is ultimately up to you if the story of Keljack ends here.

## Encounter 1: Delicate Negotiations
At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 1: [[Keljack]] K

```encounter
name: Delicate Negotiaions
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 1: [[Keljack]] 
```

Taking a huge risk, a disguised Keljack approaches the PCs in the Stumbling Giant as they recover from their latest adventure.

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Dim lanterns flicker against dark wooden walls, the scent of spiced mead and roasted meat filling the air. A bard plays a lively tune in the corner while conversations and occasional dice games echo through the room. As you settle into your seats, savoring the brief respite from danger, a hooded figure hesitantly approaches your table. The scent of damp wool and travel clings to his cloak. He glances around the room, his fingers twitching slightly before he lowers his voice. 
> 
> _"I... I need your help. And I need you to hear me out before you say no. I don’t have many options left, and I think you might be my only chance."_
> 
> His voice is steady but edged with unease. Beneath the hood, you glimpse sharp eyes and a ragged red scar, constantly scanning the room. Whatever he’s about to say, it’s clear he believes it's dangerous.  He speaks quickly, his voice tinged with urgency. 
> 
> _"I know you’ve handled things most wouldn’t dare to. I’ve found something—something powerful. But I can’t get to it alone. Not without getting killed. I need you to help me reach it… before someone else does."_
> 
> He shifts in his seat, his fingers twitching slightly. _"Magic—real magic—pulses through me. A scholar told me so before I... had a misunderstanding with her. It’s the same kind of power that’s buried deep in the Chaos Scar. I went looking for answers, and I found something—a Stasis Crystal. But the Scar is death, and I wasn’t getting out alone.  The magic in that crystal—it’s calling me. I don’t know why. But I know it matters. And I need you to help me get there."_

Keljack makes no mention of Fool and he won't join the party until they are almost to the Kings Wall.

If the characters are persuaded to accompany Keljack, he will want to leave immediately if at all possible.

If the adventurers try to put Keljack under arrest he will not resist, but will continue to beg them for their help rather then follow this course of action. Fool will eventually discover what happens and break Keljack out of the Restwell dungeons.  They will head to the Chaos Scar on their own to discover the source of the strange energy.  Keljack feels he has no choice but to try before the madness overtakes him again.

## Encounter 2: Into the Scar
**Encounter Difficulty:**   
- [ ] Trivial (40 XP) Level 12

> [!tip]+ Skill Challenge
> # Into the Scar
> 
> The adventurers must avoid the dangerous monsters that rove the Scar while either chasing Keljack or helping him to locate the crystal.
> 
> **Level:** 12 (40 xp)
> **Complexity:** 4 (requires 10 successes before 3 failures)
> **Primary Skills:**  [[skills#Arcana|Arcana]], [[skills#Occultism|Occultism]], [[skills#society|Society]], [[skills#nature|Nature]], [[skills#stealth|Stealth]]
> **Secondary Skills:** [[skills#Medicine|Medicine]], [[skills#Perception|Perception]]
> 
> ### Primary Skills
> **Arcana (DC 30, 3 successes maximum):** If Keljack is with the party, the character boosts Keljack’s ability to detect the stasis crystal through other magical emanations that pervade the Scar. Or if Keljack is being pursued, the character detects and follows the energy coming from him.
> 
> **Nature (DC 25, 3 successes maximum):** The character understands clues—markings on trees, the scarcity of other wildlife, distinctive droppings—that indicate that the adventurers are entering a dangerous creature’s territory well before they encounter the creature.
> 
> **Occultism (DC 30, 4 successes maximum):** If Keljack is with the party, the character knows that many of the Scar’s inhabitants have been warped and twisted by the presence of the meteor, and he or she can predict the creatures’ preferred hunting grounds and behavioral patterns. Or if Keljack is being pur- sued, the character can perceive the effect of the strange energy associated with the meteor, and crea- tures of the Far Realm, before they are encountered.
> 
> **Society (DC 25, 2 successes maximum):** The character recalls tales of other adventurers who have explored this area of the Chaos Scar. Although the stories are not current, they help the party avoid the area’s known threats. A **Critical Success** on this check counts as two successes instead of one. If the adventurers earn both successes possible, they can then use [[skills#Medicine|Medicine]] as a secondary skill in the challenge.
> 
> **Stealth (DC 25, 4 successes maximum):** The character scouts ahead, determining the safest route through the area, or conceals the party’s tracks. A character who gets a **Critical Success** on this check can choose to remove a failure in the challenge rather than counting this result as a success.
> 
> ### Secondary Skills
> **Medicine (DC 30, only usable after obtaining 2 success in the Society check):** The character helps an ally fight off stress and exhaustion, granting the ally a +2 bonus to his or her next check in the challenge. 
> 
> **Perception (DC 20, 1 success):** The character notices tracks or dangerous creatures before the adventurers are spotted in turn, granting a +2 bonus to the next [[skills#Nature|Nature]] check or [[skills#Stealth|Stealth]] check made in the challenge.
> 
> ### Special 
> **Sense Motive (DC 25):** If the characters are traveling with Keljack, he becomes increasingly impatient and paranoid as the journey progresses. With a successful [[sense-motive|Sense Motive]] check, a character discerns and reveals to the outlaw that Keljack’s actions are being influenced by an outside source related to the Far Realm. This knowledge makes Keljack redouble his efforts to see this quest through: The outlaw gains a +2 bonus to all attack rolls until the end of the adventure.
> 
> ### Success
> The adventurers navigate the dangers of the Scar to arrive in the area of the stasis crystal. If the adventurers are pursuing Keljack, they arrive close behind him. Go to Encounter 4
> 
> ### Failure 
> The party is attacked by a group of gnolls in service to the trapped beholder. The gnolls have orders to capture Keljack and bring him to the stasis crystal (if he is present), or to kill any who approach the area of the crystal (if Keljack is traveling ahead of the characters). Go to Encounter 3.

## Encounter 3: The Stream
**Encounter Difficulty:**   
- [ ] severe (110 XP) Level 12

![[image-2.png]]

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 2: [[gnoll-stalker|Gnoll Stalker]] S
 - 1: [[gnoll-warleader|Gnoll Warleader]] W
 - 2: [[primal-owlbear|Primal Owlbear]]

```encounter
name: The Stream
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 2: [[Gnoll Stalker]] 
- 1: [[Gnoll Warleader]]
- 2: [[Primal Owlbear]]
```

Keljack knows that the source of his feeling is in the primeval forest beyond the stream. The adventurers arrive here in his company, or close behind him, depending on their actions throughout the adventure.

The gnoll warleader is resent only if the adventurers accompany Keljack and Fool.

When the adventurers arrive at the stream, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A fast-running stream rushes from a nearby beaver dam. The trail leads to a shallow crossing before resuming on the other side.

Gnolls in service to the trapped beholder patrol this crossing with several trained owlbears. They have slain the beavers that built this dam and now ambush any creatures crossing the stream.

If the adventurers are pursuing Keljack, the outlaws were ambushed by the gnolls as they crossed the stream. Fool escaped, but Keljack was captured and is being taken to the beholder by the gnoll warleader and one of the trained owlbears. The rest of the gnolls and the owlbears are lounging in the open, not expecting another group of trespassers so soon.

If the adventurers and Keljack are traveling together, then the gnolls and the owlbears are hiding in the bushes across the stream, and the adventurers can spot them with a DC 28 Perception check. With a DC 32 Perception check, an adventurer notices numerous tracks, large and small, crisscrossing the trail on the other side of the stream.

### Tactics
If the monsters are encountered in the open, they take cover in the bushes and try to draw the adventurers across the stream before destroying the dam.

If the monsters are in hiding, they try to ambush the first adventurer who steps past the flood line on their side of the stream. The warleader then attempts to push the boulder into the dam, destroying it in hopes of separating the party.

The gnolls have been instructed to kill any creature except Keljack that tries to enter the area. The gnolls fight to the death. If no gnolls are alive to direct them, the owlbears flee when bloodied.

### Features of the Area
**Illumination:** Bright light during the day or dim light at night.
**Beaver Dam:** The gnolls have removed key pieces of the dam so that it will fall apart when hit by the boulder. An adventurer can balance on the dam with a DC 26 Acrobatics check.
**Boulder:** The boulder is perched on a steep rise over the dam and can be pushed into the dam with a DC 130 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check as a standard action. 
**Bushes:** The thick bushes on the other side of the trail are difficult terrain and provide partial concealment.
**Crossing:** The crossing is difficult terrain.
**Flood:** If the dam breaks, creatures between the flood lines must make a DC 28 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]]  check or be pushed 2d4 squares downstream.
**Flood Line:** The white dotted lines on the map indicate the level to which the water rises if the dam breaks.
**Pond:** The pond is deep but placid (DC 20 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check to swim).
**Stream:** A character must make a DC 24 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check to swim in the stream. If it is in flood, swimming the stream becomes a DC 32 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check.
**Trees:** The trees are 20 feet tall and provide partial concealment to any creature beneath their branches. The trunks can be climbed with a DC 25 [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] check. A creature pushed downstream can make a saving throw to catch the adjacent trunk or the branches of any tree it passes. If the saving throw succeeds, the forced movement ends.

## Encounter 4: An End to Madness
**Encounter Difficulty:**   
- [ ] severe (100 XP) Level 12

![[image-1.png]]

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 1: [[beholder-eye-tyrant|Beholder Eye Tyrant]] W
 - 2: [[gnoll-stalker|Gnoll Stalker]]

```encounter
name: An End to Madness
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 1: [[Beholder Eye Tyrant]] 
- 2: [[Gnoll Stalker]]
```

Beyond the stream, the forest takes on a primeval look. The trees become larger, blotting out the sun, and the ground sinks into shallow swampland. The beholder’s stasis crystal landed here as the meteor tore its way into the Scar. Energy bleeding from the crystal has preserved this section of the forest as it was when the crystal landed.

The source of Keljack’s woes is the beholder’s stasis crystal. The presence of the missing bit of magic in Keljack’s body allows the beholder to finally emerge. 

If the adventurers are pursuing Keljack, then the gnoll warleader and one trained owlbear from Encounter 3: The Stream are present, and they start adjacent to the crystal. 

As the adventurers arrive, read the following: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A large, red crystal obelisk is embedded in a hillock amid this shallow swamp. Enormous trees rise from the waters, their branches weaving a dense canopy overhead. 

If the adventurers arrive in Keljack’s company, they have the opportunity to prepare themselves for what ever happens when Keljack touches the crystal. 

Keljack hasn’t come this far to turn around now. He can feel the magic singing in his body; he knows he needs to touch the crystal. Keljack starts the encounter adjacent to the crystal. Allow the players to place their characters and Fool around the map as they see fit. With time on their side, they can easily identify and avoid the squares of grasping bog. 

If the adventurers are pursuing Keljack and succeeded in Encounter 2: Into the Scar, then they arrive as the gnoll warleader is dragging Keljack to the crystal and the beholder is being released. Fool enters the combat in the second round in an attempt to rescue Keljack. 

If the adventurers failed Encounter 2: Into the Scar and Keljack got ahead of them or was captured, the party arrives as Keljack dies beneath the beholder’s deadly gaze. Fool witnesses Keljack’s death from the trees, panics, and flees into the depths of the Scar. 

When Keljack is adjacent to the beholder or when he is killed, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Suddenly, in a flash of light, the shard flies from within Keljack’s body and reintegrates with the rest of the crystal. The stasis shell falls away in a shower of fragments, leaving a beholder hovering above the swamp and casting its gaze toward the nearest enemy. 

### Tactics
With typical arrogance, the beholder considers itself invincible against this party of adventurers. Defeat is inconceivable, and it does not retreat. 

If the adventurers accompanied Keljack here, then he is knocked unconscious by the fragment leaving his body.  Fool will scoop him up and hide him in the nearby forest.  Fool will join the fight against the beholder if the heroes appear to be in trouble. If the characters pursued Keljack to this site, then he and Fool flee for their lives, leaving the adventurers and the beholder to work out their differences. 

The gnolls are hiding in the woods watching and waiting.  Once the players engage the beholder, the emerge from the woods and join the battle.  The beholder doesn't really care about the gnolls and may catch then in it's various attacks.

### Features of the Area
**Illumination:** Dim light during the day, darkness at night. 
**Dry Land:** Small hillocks of land emerge from the water and are normal terrain. 
**Grasping Bog:** The white dotted lines on the map enclose squares of grasping bog. A grasping bog is difficult terrain. In addition, a creature that falls prone in a square of grasping bog is restrained and cannot stand up (save ends both). 
**Stasis Crystal:** The beholder’s translucent stasis crystal is 10 feet in diameter and 10 feet tall (another 5 feet of its height is buried in the bog). The crystal is slippery (DC 30 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check to climb). It is immune to damage, and it provides cover.
**Swamp:** The ground beneath the shallow water is difficult terrain. An adventurer can drop prone in the water to gain partial cover against ranged attacks.
**Trees:** The trees in this area (represented on the map by their trunks) spread their branches into a thick, interwoven canopy 20 feet above the swamp. The trees can be climbed vertically, and the canopy can be traversed horizontally, each with a DC 26 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check. 

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> If the characters search the area where the crystal shattered, they find five large pieces that can be carried away. Each of these fragments is worth 500 gp to the right buyer. The wizard [[Ailwin]] in Restwell Keep would be especially interested.
> 
> - [ ] gp::1500

## ConcludIng the Adventure 
If Keljack and Fool survive at the party’s side, their fate is up to the adventurers. Keljack asks the adventurers if they would be willing to help free Fool’s tribe from the dragon Maluriath. The red dragon and the rest of Fool’s tribe appear in the next Chaos Scar adventure, “Reflections of Ruin” (Dungeon 194). 

If Keljack and Fool flee the final encounter, the adventurers can attempt to hunt them down. If the outlaws are cornered, they fight until dead or unconscious (see the “Dead or Alive?” sidebar for more information). 

If Keljack dies, Fool might attempt to enlist the adventurers’ aid to free his tribe from the dragon, depending on his relationship with the party. 

In all cases, the death of the beholder lifts the madness from Keljack’s mind. He is free as never before to choose his own path in life, though he now ages at a normal rate. Perhaps, with the adventurers’ help, he can rise above the villainous identity he has forged for himself. 

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> If Keljack survives the fight with the beholder at the party’s side, he promises them 300 gp and a [[aeon-stone|Aeon Stone (Pink Rhomboid)]] from his personal stash once they leave the Scar. 
> 
> - [ ] gp::300
> - [ ] permanent::[[aeon-stone|Aeon Stone (Pink Rhomboid)]] [ilvl::12] [gp::1900]

If the adventurers turn them in to [[Lord Drysdale]] award them the promised 180 gp.
