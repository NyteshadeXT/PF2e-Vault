# Background
Four hundred years ago, a meteor collided with the world and left a nasty gash across the face of the Nentir Vale. Unbeknownst to anyone, the meteor also carried a passenger. An ancient beholder thought that it could hitch a ride on the meteor and touch down on a new world ripe for conquest. To survive the long journey, the beholder wrapped itself in a protective coating of crystal (using a unique version of the Stasis Shell ritual, presented in Dragon 366) and rode the meteor through the depths of space. 

Unfortunately for the beholder, a fragment of its crystal shell broke off as the meteor entered the atmosphere. The fragment struck a young man named Keljack, scarring him. Because the beholder’s shell was now not complete, the creature was unable to break free of its crystal prison. It lies in wait for the day when the shard that is part of Keljack is reunited with the rest of the crystal shell. 

In the meantime, destiny has not been kind to Keljack. Although the crystal fragment gifted Keljack with great longevity, his life has been filled with hardship and misfortune because of the disfigurement. That’s about to change. 

Now a well-known outlaw, Keljack recently discovered that his body is infused with energy similar to that coming from a particular area of the Chaos Scar. He traveled to the outskirts of the Scar and tried to pinpoint the source of the energy. Though he could feel the location of the stasis crystal dimly, he knew the Scar was too dangerous for him to venture any farther into it by himself. As he returned from this journey back to the Nentir Vale, he rescued an ogre named Fool from a pack of mutated beasts, and the two became fast friends. 

Keljack has resolved to undertake an expedition deeper into the Scar, and to attract hirelings he has spread word of a grand treasure hunt. He and Fool are going to meet with a pair of notable bandit leaders and decide which of those groups best suits their needs.

# Synopsis
While traveling between Fallcrest and Restwell Keep, the adventurers stop at the Quarter Moon  Inn. They encounter Keljack and Fool in the middle of negotiating with two groups of bandits, and the talks are going poorly. The heroes can attempt to apprehend Keljack, or they can join him on his “treasure hunt.”

Keljack and Fool lead the adventurers into the Scar; the characters might be pursing them, or they might all be traveling together. Either way, the heroes must contend with servants of the trapped beholder before arriving at the stasis crystal.

 In the final encounter, Keljack’s proximity to the beholder finally releases the creature from the crystal. The adventurers must prevail over the beholder before deciding Keljack’s ultimate fate.

# Running the Adventure

When the adventure starts, the heroes find them selves in one of two situations.

**Meeting the Blades** Some inexperienced adventurers calling themselves Bathram’s Blades are at the Slumbering Giant in Restwell Keep celebrating their return from their first expedition into the Chaos Scar. Between drunken tales of their exploits, the Blades talk about the close call they had with the outlaw Keljack and his new ogre sidekick, Fool. The two were seen on the southern edge of the King’s Wall about a week ago as the Blades traveled away from the Scar, and they might still be in the area. 

The Blades can impart any of the commonly held beliefs about Keljack (see below) if any character makes a successful DC 28 [[skills#Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] check.

**Job Board Posting** Wanted for Murder, Robbery, Assault and other crimes: Keljack and his ogre companion. Lord Criswell offers 150 gold for his head and 30 for the ogre. 

## Keljack
Keljack is well known throughout the lands surrounding the Chaos Scar. Bandit leader, outlaw, mercenary—Keljack has been all of these things and more.

Bards say he was birthed from the egg of a red dragon, yet appears human. The scar that mars his face grants him immense power, they say. Unequaled in skill with a longsword, he never draws first and never attacks without warning. Many people consider Keljack a celebrity, even as they fear his presence. He is a man whom people love to hate, even if his reputation far surpasses his actual abilities.

The truth is far less colorful. Keljack, born Kellem Jackson, was a teenager when the meteor that caused the Chaos Scar passed overhead. A fragment of the beholder’s stasis shell broke off as the meteor entered the atmosphere, and that sliver struck Kellem in the face. He survived, but the fragment transferred its magic into Kellem’s body and left him bearing a large, vivid scar. Those who looked upon him immediately afterward saw his disfigurement, coinciding as it did with the meteor’s arrival, as an ill omen, and he was ostracized.

Bitter and angry, Kellem resolved that if people were going to curse his name, they would do so because of his deeds and not because of his disfigurement. He stole his father’s longsword, joined a local bandit gang, and never looked back. Wanting no connection with the hapless farmer he had once been, he changed his name to Keljack and embarked on a career of banditry and terror.

For reasons Keljack doesn’t understand, he suffers periodic bouts of madness. When he comes to his senses, his body is rejuvenated and revitalized, but his skills are rusty from disuse. What he doesn’t realize is that the magic of the shard that struck him is keeping him from aging, but at the same time that sliver is tainted by its connection to the beholder—it imbues Keljack with a healthy dose of the beholder’s own insanity and paranoia. As the shard keeps him young, it also regularly drives him insane.

During his periods of lucidity, Keljack returns to and remains in the region. He has found that the farther removed he is from the Chaos Scar, the more easily he can stave off the madness. Even so, the bouts of insanity are lasting longer and longer, and he wonders if the day might come when he never regains his senses.

Recently, Keljack ambushed a wandering scholar in search of loot. The woman had no valuables, but she escaped with her life and health by telling the outlaw something he had never heard before: Magic emanated from Keljack, and it was similar to the energy that her fellow scholars had detected deep within the southern forest of the Chaos Scar.

Keljack suspected this energy was related to his madness, so he traveled to the Scar to find the truth. Even though he sensed the stasis crystal somewhere ahead of him, he realized that he was no match for the monsters of the Scar and turned back. On his way out, he saved the life of the ogre named Fool, and the two quickly became friends. 

Now, Keljack and Fool are at the Quarter Moon Inn to meet with prospective hirelings. Keljack feels that another bout of insanity is fast approaching, and this upcoming expedition could be his last chance to find out the truth about himself before he loses his mind once more.

## Fool
This ogre is exceptionally intelligent. As he grew to adulthood and realized how different he was from the other ogres in his tribe, he decided to conceal his intelligence and act the part of a dimwit. Some time ago, his tribe came under the dominion of a red dragon named Maluriath, who had been corrupted by the chaotic energy of a Deck of Many Things. The dragon named the ogres after the various cards in the deck, and this particular ogre was dubbed “Fool.”

Unlike the other ogres, Fool was smart enough to see that the dragon cared not for the tribe but only for itself. Determined to get his tribe out from under the dragon’s rule, he escaped and set out looking for help. As he reached the fringe of the Chaos Scar, he was attacked by monsters that threatened to end his quest before it could begin. Keljack was nearby when this assault occurred, and he helped Fool dispatch the monsters.

When Keljack saved Fool’s life, Fool couldn’t believe his good fortune. Though his tribe hails from deep within the Chaos Scar, Fool had heard stories of Keljack from travelers over the years. If anyone could defeat the dragon and free his people, it would be this man. He agreed to help Keljack solve the mystery of his scar and Keljack, in turn, agreed to help him vanquish the dragon afterward.

Fool is in no way a stereotypical ogre. Smart, analytical, and difficult to anger, he tries to plan for every contingency. He maintains a “dumb ogre” facade, even away from his tribe, when dealing with those he doesn’t know. Never very social, Fool has found in Keljack something he never expected when he fled his tribe: a friend

## The Beholder
At first, the beholder railed against its imprisonment. The stasis shell that kept it alive during its journey on the meteor now keeps it trapped until the missing shard can be reunited with the rest of the crystal. Through years of experimentation, the beholder figured out how to extend a small amount of its power beyond the crystal’s confines. Unwilling to become a curio in some wizard’s tower, the beholder dominated monsters and explorers that uncovered its resting place, and it used those captive creatures to ward off other snoopers. Its latest conquest is a small pack of gnolls.

The beholder sensed when Keljack neared the Scar on his first expedition, and along the connection between itself and Keljack, it was able to perceive an image of the outlaw. Now most of its gnolls roam the Scar under specific orders to capture Keljack and bring him to the crystal.

## Price on Their Heads
Faren Markelhay, Lord Warden of Fallcrest, is out to make a name for himself. Capturing Keljack would be a triumph for his political career, for the peace of the Nentir Vale, and for justice. He knows that going after Keljack personally would be foolhardy, especially since the outlaw has been seen with an ogre recently. But he’s pretty sure that raising the bounty on both of those outlaws will attract the talent needed to bring them in.

Wanted posters (see below) are displayed prominently at inns and taverns throughout Fallcrest and the Nentir Vale. The accusations leveled at Keljack are largely true, though perhaps embellished by the passage of time. The accusations against Fool are entirely fabricated, but to the Lord Warden, they seem like crimes an ogre would commit.

Keljack
By the order of the Lord Warden of Fallcrest, the outlaw Keljack—known for the prominent and distinctive scar across his face, and being of moderate height and surly disposition—is wanted alive! He has pillaged, murdered, and committed a sundry host of villainous shenanigans too numerous to list. Any who deliver Keljack alive to Fallcrest will be paid the sum of 3,000 gold pieces.

Fool
By the order of the Lord Warden of Fallcrest, an ogre calling himself Fool, known to wield a morningstar and a handaxe, and also known to travel in the company of Keljack the outlaw, is wanted alive! He has committed murder, destroyed property, and stolen sheep. Any who deliver this ogre alive to Fallcrest will receive the sum of 600 gold pieces.

setup
Keljack (K)
Fool (M)
Char, tiefling occultist (O)
Flip, gnome illusionist (G)
3 tiefling furies (F)
3 gnome assassins (A)
Keljack is negotiating with two small-time bandit groups—Char’s Furies and Flip’s Shadows—for who should have the privilege of accompanying him to his “treasure.” He thought to play one group off the other and gain a favorable cut of whatever is found within the Scar, but the negotiations have hit an impasse. Fabulous treasure is supposedly at stake, and neither group wants to allow the other to leave with Keljack. When the adventurers make their entrance, every- thing changes.
As the adventurers approach the Quarter Moon Inn, read:
The Quarter Moon Inn looks busy today. Four strong horses are tethered out front, and chatter drifts through the doorway and windows.
The adventurers notice the wanted posters for Keljack and Fool plastered on a board outside the tavern. If they look around further, they can find a rear door and two more horses, around back. A second story has bedrooms where travelers can spend the night and windows that can be opened without difficulty. (The owners of the Quarter 
Moon, the halfling brothers Heller and Mir, are                                                                                   hiding in the kitchen until Keljack leaves, praying he doesn’t wreck the place.)
If the adventurers look in a window, so that they can see and hear Keljack and Fool, read:
A man with a scarred face is playing cards with a tiefling and a gnome. An ogre sits by himself at a nearby table and sneers at the others.
Allow the adventurers to be creative in planning their entrance to the inn. The outlaws have a passive Per- ception of 15 for noticing any sneaking or subterfuge.
If the adventurers enter openly, Keljack greets them with a smile: The adventurers are just the type of people he seeks. He tries to use his reputation to convince the adventurers to help them find his “trea- sure.” His paranoia is hard at work, and already he doesn’t trust either Char or Flip.
If the characters are persuaded to accompany Keljack and Fool, Char and Flip become enraged. They forge a temporary truce and gang up on the adventurers.
If the adventurers try to put Keljack under arrest or if they charge into the tavern, Char and Flip fight to cover Keljack’s escape with the hope of rejoining him later.
Tactics
If the heroes have come to arrest them, Keljack and Fool attempt to flee as soon as possible and in any available direction—out the doors, through the win- dows, or up the stairs—though neither leaves the other behind if he appears incapable of following. Keljack steals a horse, trusting Fool’s natural speed to keep up. They each have a potion of healing.
If the adventurers plan to accompany Keljack, he and Fool fight on their side against the other bandits.
Fool’s preferred tactic, in either situation, is to cut the chandelier with a thrown handaxe and send it 

### The Quarter Moon Inn
Between Fallcrest and Restwell Keep lies the Quarter Moon Inn, a roadside tavern and way station run by the halfling brothers Heller and Mir Halfmoon (cousins of Selarund Halfmoon in Fallcrest). Famed for its pies, both savory and sweet, the inn is a popular stopping point for travelers.
Whether the adventurers track down Keljack and Fool (hook 1) or you use the outlaw duo as a chance encounter (hook 2), the adventurers come upon them in the inn as the two outlaws meet with a pair of bandit leaders.

### Following a Feeling
Traveling through the Chaos Scar is neither safe nor easy. Accompanied by or in pursuit of Keljack, the adventurers must avoid the dangers of the Scar and the beholder’s forces as they make their way to the vast forest along the Scar’s southern border.
These events lead up to Encounter 2: Into the Scar.

### The Stream Crossing
About a mile from the stasis crystal, the party comes to a fast-running stream beneath a beaver dam. Part of the stream is shallow enough to cross, but the beholder’s servants, gnolls and their trained owlbears, watch the crossing, ready to take advantage of the ter- rain to isolate and devour travelers.
These events lead up to Encounter 3: The Stream.

### The Ancient Forest
Beyond the stream, the forest takes on a primeval look. The trees become larger, blotting out the sun, and the ground sinks into shallow swampland. The beholder’s stasis crystal landed here as the meteor tore its way into the Scar. Energy bleeding from the crystal has preserved this section of the forest as it was when the crystal landed.

After the heroes have crossed or circumvented the stream, the adventure ends with Encounter 4: An End to Madness.
