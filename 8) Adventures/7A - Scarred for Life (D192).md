# Background
Four hundred years ago, a meteor collided with the world and left a nasty gash across the face of the Nentir Vale. Unbeknownst to anyone, the meteor also carried a passenger. An ancient beholder thought that it could hitch a ride on the meteor and touch down on a new world ripe for conquest. To survive the long journey, the beholder wrapped itself in a protective coating of crystal (using a unique version of the Stasis Shell ritual, presented in Dragon 366) and rode the meteor through the depths of space. 

Unfortunately for the beholder, a fragment of its crystal shell broke off as the meteor entered the atmosphere. The fragment struck a young man named Keljack, scarring him. Because the beholder’s shell was now not complete, the creature was unable to break free of its crystal prison. It lies in wait for the day when the shard that is part of Keljack is reunited with the rest of the crystal shell. 

In the meantime, destiny has not been kind to Keljack. Although the crystal fragment gifted Keljack with great longevity, his life has been filled with hardship and misfortune because of the disfigurement. That’s about to change. 

Now a well-known outlaw, Keljack recently discovered that his body is infused with energy similar to that coming from a particular area of the Chaos Scar. He traveled to the outskirts of the Scar and tried to pinpoint the source of the energy. Though he could feel the location of the stasis crystal dimly, he knew the Scar was too dangerous for him to venture any farther into it by himself. As he returned from this journey back to the Nentir Vale, he rescued an ogre named Fool from a pack of mutated beasts, and the two became fast friends. 

Keljack has resolved to undertake an expedition deeper into the Scar, and to attract hirelings he has spread word of a grand treasure hunt. He and Fool are going to meet with a pair of notable bandit leaders and decide which of those groups best suits their needs.

# Synopsis
While traveling between Fallcrest and Restwell Keep, the adventurers stop at the Quarter Moon  Inn. They encounter Keljack and Fool in the middle of negotiating with two groups of bandits, and the talks are going poorly. The heroes can attempt to apprehend Keljack, or they can join him on his “treasure hunt.”

Keljack and Fool lead the adventurers into the Scar; the characters might be pursing them, or they might all be traveling together. Either way, the heroes must contend with servants of the trapped beholder before arriving at the stasis crystal.

 In the final encounter, Keljack’s proximity to the beholder finally releases the creature from the crystal. The adventurers must prevail over the beholder before deciding Keljack’s ultimate fate.

# Running the Adventure

When the adventure starts, the heroes find them selves in one of two situations.

 Hook 1: Meeting the Blades
 Some inexperienced adventurers calling themselves 
Bathram’s Blades are at the Nentir Inn in Fallcrest 
celebrating their return from their first expedition 
into the Chaos Scar. Between drunken tales of their 
exploits, the Blades talk about the close call they had 
with the outlaw Keljack and his new ogre sidekick, 
Fool. The two were seen on the southern edge of the 
King’s Wall about a week ago as the Blades traveled 
away from the Scar, and they might still be in the 
area. Someone suggests that the Quarter Moon Inn, 
on the road between Fallcrest and Restwell Keep, gets 
a lot of traffic to and from the Scar, so it would be a 
good place to go for more information.

 If you’re using this hook, the Blades can impart 
any of the commonly held beliefs about Keljack (see 
below) if any character makes a successful DC 12 
Streetwise check.

 Hook 2: Action at the Inn
 The heroes are passing by the Quarter Moon Inn and 
decide to stop for a meal at the moment Keljack is 
concluding his negotiations inside with two groups of 
bandits.

-   Wanted for Murder, Robbery, Assault and other crimes: Keljack and his ogre companion. Lord Criswell offers 2,500 gold for his head and 500 for the ogre. (Scarred for Life)

 If you’re using this hook, the adventure starts 
without any prelude, and the characters learn about 
Keljack and his situation as the plot unfolds.

 keljack
 Keljack is well known throughout the Nentir Vale and 
the lands surrounding the Chaos Scar. Bandit leader, 
outlaw, mercenary—Keljack has been all of these 
things and more.

 Bards say he was birthed from the egg of a red 
dragon, yet appears human. The scar that mars his 
face grants him immense power, they say. Unequaled 
in skill with a longsword, he never draws first and 
never attacks without warning. Many people in the 
Nentir Vale consider Keljack a celebrity, even as they 
fear his presence. He is a man whom people love to 
hate, even if his reputation far surpasses his actual 
abilities.

 The truth is far less colorful. Keljack, born Kellem 
Jackson, was a teenager when the meteor that caused 
the Chaos Scar passed overhead. A fragment of the 
beholder’s stasis shell broke off as the meteor entered 
the atmosphere, and that sliver struck Kellem in the 
face. He survived, but the fragment transferred its 
magic into Kellem’s body and left him bearing a large, 
vivid scar. Those who looked upon him immediately 
afterward saw his disfigurement, coinciding as it did 
with the meteor’s arrival, as an ill omen, and he was 
ostracized.

 Bitter and angry, Kellem resolved that if people 
were going to curse his name, they would do so 
because of his deeds and not because of his disfigure
ment. He stole his father’s longsword, joined a local 
bandit gang, and never looked back. Wanting no con
nection with the hapless farmer he had once been, 
he changed his name to Keljack and embarked on a 
career of banditry and terror.

 For reasons Keljack doesn’t understand, he suffers 
periodic bouts of madness. When he comes to his 
senses, his body is rejuvenated and revitalized, but his 
skills are rusty from disuse. What he doesn’t realize 
is that the magic of the shard that struck him is keep
ing him from aging, but at the same time that sliver 
is tainted by its connection to the beholder—it imbues 
Keljack with a healthy dose of the beholder’s own 
insanity and paranoia. As the shard keeps him young, 
it also regularly drives him insane.

 During his periods of lucidity, Keljack returns to 
and remains in the Nentir Vale. He has found that the 
farther removed he is from the Chaos Scar, the more 
easily he can stave off the madness. Even so, the bouts 
of insanity are lasting longer and longer, and he won
ders if the day might come when he never regains his 
senses.

 Recently, Keljack ambushed a wandering scholar 
in search of loot. The woman had no valuables, but 
she escaped with her life and health by telling the 
outlaw something he had never heard before: Magic 
emanated from Keljack, and it was similar to the 
energy that her fellow scholars had detected deep 
within the southern forest of the Chaos Scar.

 Keljack suspected this energy was related to his 
madness, so he traveled to the Scar to find the truth. 
Even though he sensed the stasis crystal somewhere 
ahead of him, he realized that he was no match for 
the monsters of the Scar and turned back. On his way 
out, he saved the life of the ogre named Fool, and the two quickly became friends. 

Now, Keljack and Fool are at the Quarter Moon Inn to meet with prospective hirelings. Keljack feels that another bout of insanity is fast approaching, and this upcoming expedition could be his last chance to find out the truth about himself before he loses his mind once more.

Fool
 This ogre is exceptionally intelligent. As he grew to 
adulthood and realized how different he was from 
the other ogres in his tribe, he decided to conceal 
his intelligence and act the part of a dimwit. Some 
time ago, his tribe came under the dominion of a red 
dragon named Maluriath, who had been corrupted 
by the chaotic energy of a Deck of Many Things. The 
dragon named the ogres after the various cards in the 
deck, and this particular ogre was dubbed “Fool.”

 Unlike the other ogres, Fool was smart enough to 
see that the dragon cared not for the tribe but only 
for itself. Determined to get his tribe out from under 
the dragon’s rule, he escaped and set out looking for 
help. As he reached the fringe of the Chaos Scar, he 
was attacked by monsters that threatened to end his 
quest before it could begin. Keljack was nearby when 
this assault occurred, and he helped Fool dispatch 
the monsters.

 When Keljack saved Fool’s life, Fool couldn’t 
believe his good fortune. Though his tribe hails from 
deep within the Chaos Scar, Fool had heard stories of 
Keljack from travelers over the years. If anyone could 
defeat the dragon and free his people, it would be this 
man. He agreed to help Keljack solve the mystery of 
his scar and Keljack, in turn, agreed to help him van
quish the dragon afterward.

 Fool is in no way a stereotypical ogre. Smart, ana
lytical, and difficult to anger, he tries to plan for every 
contingency. He maintains a “dumb ogre” facade, 
even away from his tribe, when dealing with those 
he doesn’t know. Never very social, Fool has found in 
Keljack something he never expected when he fled 
his tribe: a friend
