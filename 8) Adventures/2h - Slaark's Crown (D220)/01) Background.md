Around six months ago, a band of goblins and hobgoblins discovered an abandoned dungeon beneath a small hill in the wilderness. They explored the ruin and began converting it to their needs, intent on using it as their own center of power. 

For several months, the monsters toiled in and around their fortress, led by a hulking hobgoblin named Drekesh. They transformed the dungeon’s rooms into a home, complete with living quarters, a mess hall, and a prison for their enemies. One particularly skilled and intelligent goblin arcanist named Slaark took the lead in converting the abandoned complex to its new function. He designed and crafted traps and locks to protect the finished chambers. 

The other goblins and hobgoblins saw that Slaark had the best ideas and that Drekesh was content to simply order them around. Slaark sensed this fact and, with choice words, he persuaded the others to rise up and kill Drekesh, leaving Slaark in charge. 

Slaark continued his work, ordering the construction of a wooden palisade atop the small hill that marked the entrance to the subterranean fortress. The monsters cut the tops off several large trees and built the palisade between them, creating a roughly circular wall that had appearance of a wooden crown. His troops named the fortress “Slaark’s Crown” and proclaimed Slaark their king. 

When the defenses were complete, Slaark ordered his troops to raid the lands around Slaark’s Crown. They attacked farms and travelers, amassing food, supplies, and wealth. Anyone who resisted was killed or captured and forced to work in the dungeon. 

Ten days ago, Slaark sent troops to deliver messages to several nearby settlements, describing the tribute they should pay Slaark if they wished to avoid further attacks. In the time since, Slaark has ordered his troops to conduct raids on travelers and spy on the settlements in his domain.
