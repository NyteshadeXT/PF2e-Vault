![[Pasted image 20230828225940.png|right|450]]
The crystal dragon Karonzaxus was recently slain by a group of adventurers near the Chaos Scar, and tales of the mighty deed echo through the land. However, unbeknownst to the victorious adventurers, Karonzaxus was female, and had recently become the proud mother of a single male crystal wyrmling, whom she named Taloklaxus. After the death of Karonzaxus, her killers looted her lair but did not discover the wyrmling, who was small enough to hide and avoid detection. With no choice but to fend for himself, Taloklaxus left his mother’s lair in the Chaos Scar and ventured out into the world. He would certainly have been killed and eaten by a more powerful monster but instead, the first creatures he encountered were a warband of serpentfolk from the Scintillating Scale clutch. The Venom Caller leading the group, Varza, an ambitious and progressive serpentfolk, saw the wyrmling as a sign; a sign that it was time to leave her clutch and strike out on her own. 

Varza persuaded her warband to join her by promising that the crystal wyrmling was the key to future power and influence in the Chaos Scar. Needing a base of operations, Varza followed Taloklaxus’s tracks back to his mother’s lair, and there began instructing the wyrmling in the finer points of dragonhood. Of course, Varza wished to turn her wyrmling into a rampaging monster. In order to do so, however, she needed to expunge the more peaceable inclinations common to crystal dragons from Taloklaxus’s psyche. Preferring a hands-on approach, Varza and her serpent-kin began raiding local tribes of goblins and kobold clans for suitable ‘teaching aids’ for Taloklaxus. Those taken were disarmed and forced to battle the crystal wyrmling to the death. 

Taloklaxus is not an evil creature, but it now has a child’s loyalty to Varza and follows the venom caller’s commands. Taloklaxus believes that he must slay the helpless creatures Varza forces him to battle in order to sharpen the fighting skills he needs to defend Varza and the serpentfolk loyal to her. In the past few weeks, Taloklaxus’s natural instincts have become more prominent, and he has begun to question Varza’s commands. This has not slowed Varza’s ambition, however, and she has begun to venture beyond the King’s Wall to collect ‘training partners’ for her pet wyrmling.

# Adventure Hooks
**Scaling Rewards ([[Restwell Jobs#Word of Mouth|Word of Mouth]] ):** The characters are approached by [[Bergen]] who tells them he was recently hired by the group of adventurers responsible for slaying the crystal dragon Karonzaxus. The adventurers hired him to craft armor from the dragon’s scales, which he did. He is convinced that there are more dragon scales in Karonzaxus’ lair, and he offers to pay the characters 200 gp if they can collect enough dragon scales to fashion a shield or a suit of armor. [[Bergen]]  knows the location of the dragon’s lair from talking with the adventurers within the Chaos Scar and gives the characters a rough map if they agree to his terms.

**Woeful Woodwives ([[Restwell Jobs#Word of Mouth|Word of Mouth]]):** It is fairly common knowledge that local woodcutters are crossing into the Chaos Scar to harvest the bountiful forests beyond the King’s Wall. The boldest of these woodcutters, Erim Haverlan and his two grown sons, disappeared over two weeks ago, and their wives fear the worst. The PC's are approached by [[Wara]] on behalf of the wives and ask them to enter the Chaos Scar and search the small forests near the King’s Wall for their husbands. The woodcutters’ wives are poor working folk, but they have managed to scrape together 50 gp to pay the characters if they can locate their husbands, dead or alive. The [[Wara]] can provide detailed descriptions of the three missing woodcutters and roughly where they were harvesting if the characters agree to search for them.

> [!danger]+ Trap
> [[mantrap_patch-hb|Mantrap Patch]]

Fearing reprisal from the rest of the Scintillating Scale clutch, Varza has instructed her serpent-kin to be vigilant for intruders and has ensured the entrance to the lair is well guarded. They have improved their defenses by felling two large trees which serve as barricades and a convenient place from which to snipe at enemies. In addition, the devious creatures have hidden a number of mantraps beneath the forest litter in the clearing. These spiked mechanical jaws can close with bone-snapping force, holding a victim in place until he or she can pry the jaws open again.

The serpentfolk are not expecting trouble, but Varza has commanded they be vigilant. There are currently ten serpentfolk hunkered down behind the two fallen trees in the clearing watching for any signs of intruders. The serpentfolk are taking pains to stay out of sight and have a passive [[skills#Stealth|Stealth]] check of 18. Should the characters attempt to sneak into the clearing, they must succeed at a DC 18 [[skills#Stealth|Stealth]] check to beat the serpent folk's passive [[skills#Perception|Perception]]. If the characters fail to spot the hiding serpentfolk, the heroes are surprised.

Read or paraphrase the following when the characters reach the clearing:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A narrow, winding path ends in a small forest clearing. The area is quite bare, containing little more than a pair of fallen trees, a shallow pool, and a small hillock at the southern end of the clearing. A cavern yawns open at the base of the hillock, and you can faintly hear the sound of rushing water from the darkness within.

When the kobolds attack, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Shadowy figures move behind the two fallen trees in the clearing, and the air is suddenly filled with a hail of arrows. You are under attack!

## Tactics
The serpentfolk attack almost immediately. They won’t give the characters more than a few seconds to scan the clearing before initiative is rolled—too short a time for active Perception checks. After that, characters must devote actions to making [[skills#Perception|Perception]] checks, and the serpentfolk intend to keep them too busy for that.

The serpentfolk remain behind the fallen trees for as long as possible, peppering the characters with arrows until they run out or the characters have closed in to melee with them. Once serpentfolk are in melee, the Aapoph will engage and the Zyss will pull back to threaten ranged attackers, to keep away from the most dangerous opponents, and to draw characters into the traps, if they haven’t been detected already.

Note that each mantrap patch actually consists of four independently-trapped squares.

When only four serpentfolk remain, a single serpentfolk will try to break away from combat. Unless the characters can prevent it, the serpentfolk runs into the cavern to warn its friends in area 2.

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** Daylight.

**Fallen Trees:** Squares covered by the fallen trees are difficult terrain as shown. The fallen trees provide greater cover to Small creatures adjacent to them or standard cover to Medium creatures.

**Pool:** The small pool is 2 feet deep and is difficult terrain.

# Encounter 2 - The Roaring Cavern 
**Encounter Difficulty:** Severe (120 xp)

![[Pasted image 20230829115350.png|right]]

Creatures:
 - 3: [[zyss-serpentfolk|Zyss Serpentfolk]] S
 - 4: [[granitescale-serpentfolk|Granitescale Serpentfolk]] D

```encounter
name: Hangman
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 3: [[Zyss Serpentfolk]] 
- 4: [[Granitescale Serpentfolk]]
```

This small cavern is bisected by a swiftly running stream that flows south into a shaft in the cavern floor, where it plunges 20 feet before crashing into an underground lake. The falling water makes a terrible noise, and the serpentfolk here are all but deaf to intruders. Because of the noise, all creatures in this area suffer a -5 penalty to [[skills#perception|Perception]] checks. Conversation is possible only with adjacent creatures, and even then only by shouting.

If one of the serpentfolk from area 1 managed to warn the serpentfolk in this area, they are on alert and actively looking for intruders. In that event, the serpentfolk here do not suffer the -5 penalty to [[skills#Perception|Perception]] for the purpose of spotting enemies entering the cavern but have their full passive [[skills#Perception|Perception]] score of 18. The serpentfolk still suffer the penalty for all other [[skills#Perception|Perception]] checks during the encounter.

After the serpentfolk from area 1 warned the serpentfolk in this area, it intended to move on and warn Varza and the serpentfolk in Karonzaxuss’ lair. At the beginning of this encounter, however, the it is still present, behind the Granitescales at the southern end of the cavern. It leaves the map at its first opportunity, so characters with high initiative scores may have a chance to kill it with a ranged attack before it can escape and warn Varza in area 3.

When the characters enter the cavern, read:> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A swift, dark stream flows through the center of this lightless cavern. The water flows to the south before falling into a gaping pit in the floor and crashing down into unseen depths below. The rushing water fills the cavern with thunderous noise, leaving you all but deaf to the danger that may lurk in the darkness.

When the characters see the kobolds,
read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Seven serpentfolk stand on the eastern side of the cavern, using the rushing stream as a natural barrier between them and you. They grip an assortment of melee and ranged weapons and look quite ready to use them.

## Tactics
When combat begins, the zyss open up on the heroes with special shot aimed at obvious barbarians, fighters, or other melee types. The granitescales stand their ground and wait for the characters to close for melee.

In melee, the granitescales move into flanking positions. They won’t shy away from trying to bull-rush enemies into the stream or the pit if a good opportunity arises. Their main tactic, however, is to defend their side of the stream in the hope that the intruders rush across it. The zyss avoid melee when possible, using shifty to keep away from close combat and their ranged attacks against enemies that seem reluctant to cross the stream.

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** Darkness.

**Ceiling:** 20 feet high.

**Pit:** The pit is a 10-foot-wide vertical shaft, hundreds of feet deep, that eventually connects to a subterranean river. However, it is filled almost entirely with water so that the waterline is only 20 feet below the cavern floor. A character falling into the pit takes 1d10 damage. The water in the pit is quite turbulent, so that it takes a DC 15 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check to tread water and stay afloat. Climbing out of the pit takes a DC 10 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check.

**Rubble:** Squares with rubble are difficult terrain. These rubble piles are large enough to offer cover to adjacent creatures of Small size or smaller.

**Rushing Stream:** The stream is 3 feet deep and flowing swiftly. A character who makes an [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check (DC 11, or DC 21 without a running start) can leap safely across it. Any creature that enters the water suffers the following attack as an immediate reaction: +3 vs. Reflex; the target is knocked prone and is pushed 3 squares downstream toward the pit. A creature that starts its turn in the stream is pushed 3 squares downstream before it can take any other action. A prone creature in the stream must make a DC 13 [[skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] or [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check. A creature dragged into the pit by the current can make a saving throw as normal to avoid falling into the water below.

# Encounter 3 - Lair of Karonzaxus
**Encounter Difficulty:** Severe (130 xp)

![[Pasted image 20230829134121.png|right]]

Creatures:
 - 4: [[zyss-serpentfolk|Zyss Serpentfolk]] S
 - 3: [[granitescale-serpentfolk|Granitescale Serpentfolk]] D
 - 1: [[serpentfolk-venom-caller|Serpentfolk Venom Caller]] K

- 1: [[Young Crystal Dragon, Taloklaxus]]
```

This cavern was once the lair of the crystal dragon Karonzaxus. It has become in many ways a prison for her offspring, the crystal wyrmling Taloklaxus.

When the characters enter the cavern, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A slow-moving stream flowing west to east divides this large cavern in half. At first glance, the water looks shallow enough to simply wade across. In the southwestern portion of the room, the skeleton of a large dragon lies curled nose to tail. Only shreds of flesh and scales still cling to its bones.

Varza has been forcing Taloklaxus to fight and kill unarmed humanoids from local goblin and kobold tribes, and recently, she has been kidnapping innocent travelers from beyond the King’s Wall to further sharpen Taloklaxus’s fighting skills.

Taloklaxus felt no remorse about slaying the goblins, kobolds, and other evil humanoids he was initially forced to battle. However, killing the humans and other civilized folk Varza captured from beyond the King’s Wall has brought about feelings of remorse, leaving the wyrmling confused and depressed. He is for the moment still Varza’s creature, however, and follows her commands.

When the characters see Taloklaxus, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> In the southern end of the room, near the bloodstained corpses of several humans, crouches a dragon the size of a large wolf. Its scales are crystal and its large head is armed with a formidable beak. It does not stir when you enter, and only the hiss of a serpentfolk voice to the east manages to push it reluctantly to its feet.

When the characters see Taloklaxus, they can make a DC 10 [[skills#Nature|Nature]] check to recognize him as a crystal wyrmling. This check is sufficient to tell them that crystal dragons are not usually evil and do not normally associate with serpentfolk.

When the characters see serpentfolk, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The dragonling is not the only danger in this cavern. Over half a dozen serpentfolk lurk in the shadows, including a tall, green-scaled specimen shouting orders to the other serpentfolk in a hissing form of common.

The serpentfolk here may be expecting trouble if the serpentfolk runner from area 2 was able to warn them of the characters’ presence. If this happens, add that serpentfolk to this encounter. Even if they received no warning, the kserpentfolk in the southern end of the cavern are watching the entrance to this area, and the characters need a [[skills#Stealth|Stealth]] check of 12 to enter without being noticed. If they are carrying a light source, the serpentfolk will notice them automatically in the darkness.

Once combat begins, Varza shouts commands to Taloklaxus in Draconic from the eastern side of the cavern, urging the wyrmling to slay the intruders. Taloklaxus, however, is racked by guilt over the humans he killed recently, and so fights only halfheartedly. Until it becomes bloodied, the dragon has a –4 penalty on all of its damage rolls.

Every turn on which Taloklaxus attacks a player character, allow that character to attempt a DC 13 [[skills#Perception|Sense Motive]] check. If the check succeeds, the character realizes that the wyrmling is holding back on its attacks. Once a character has succeeded at one of these [[skills#Perception|Sense Motive]] checks, the characters can attempt the Turning Taloklaxus skill challenge to win Taloklaxus over to their side against Varza. Let the  players come up with this idea on their own! Don’t just tell them, “now you can try a skill challenge.”

## Skill Challenge - Turning Taloklaxus

The characters must convince Taloklaxus his true enemies are Varza and her serpentfolk minions.

**Level:** 5 (100 xp)
**Complexity:** 2 (requires 6 successes before 3 failures)
**Primary Skills:**  [[skills#diplomacy|Diplomacy]], [[skills#Intimidate|Intimidate]]
**Secondary Skills:** [[skills#Nature|Nature]], [[skills#Religion|Religion]]
**Special:** Any character that speaks Draconic gains a +2 bonus to all primary skill checks made as part of this skill challenge.  Once the skill challenge begins, it is imperative that the characters keep up their arguments to Taloklaxus. On any round that the characters do not attempt a primary skill check, they earn one failure. Once a character damages Taloklaxus on a given round, all subsequent skill checks made as part of this skill challenge during that round suffer a -2 penalty.

### Primary Skills
**Diplomacy (DC 13, standard action; 1 success, no maximum):** By appealing to the wyrmling’s intellect and sense of reason, you try to convince him the serpentfolk do not have his best interests at heart.

**Intimidate (DC 21, standard action; 1 success, no maximum):** Your words carry a subtle threat. You try to convince the wyrmling that fighting you can only result in pain and death.

### Secondary Skills
**Nature (DC 13, minor action; no successes):** You have a keen understanding of dragonkind, and your knowledge can help your companions choose the right words to sway the crystal wyrmling. You grant a +2 bonus to one ally’s next [[skills#diplomacy|Diplomacy]] or [[skills#Intimidate|Intimidate]] check made as part of this skill challenge.

**Religion (DC 21, minor action, no successes):** You invoke the name of Bahamut, the great platinum dragon to lend weight to the words and actions of your companions. You grant a +2 bonus to one ally’s next [[skills#diplomacy|Diplomacy]] or [[skills#Intimidate|Intimidate]] check made as part of this skill challenge.

### Success
The characters persuade Taloklaxus that they are not his enemies, and his true enemies are the serpentfolk who forced him to commit atrocities unworthy of an crystal dragon. How fully he joins in the fight depends on how many failures the characters scored during the skill challenge.

**- Zero Failures:** the dragon is enraged. He fights as an ally and causes full damage with his attacks.
**- One Failure:** the dragon switches sides but is still confused. He fights as an ally but with a –4 penalty on his damage rolls.
**- Two Failures:** the dragon is even more confused than before. He takes wing and tries to fly out of the cavern without attacking anyone. Characters will find him curled up outside after the fight.

### Failure 
If the characters fail to persuade Taloklaxus that they are not his enemies, his confusion turns to blind rage. He attacks the characters with furious aggression and causes full damage with his attacks. The heroes must fight the wyrmling and may be forced to kill him.

## Tactics
In the first round of combat, the Granitescale's hurl their javelins at characters, while the Zyss use nearby rubble to hide. Taloklaxus waits for the characters to cross the stream before attacking, while Varza waits for the characters to engage Taloklaxus, then opens up with acid arrow, targeting likely spellcasters.

In melee, the Zyss team up on a single character attacking from range. The the Granitescales move into melee to keep characters from the Zyss. Taloklaxus engages the heroes reluctantly and fights halfheartedly, pulling some of the power from his melee attacks (–4 penalty to damage rolls). He focuses his attacks against characters wearing the heaviest armor, hoping that the armor will turn aside his claws and teeth. He is still too young and inexperienced to realize that his crystalline claws slice easily through armor. Taloklaxus does use draconic frenzy each round, because he knows how Varza expects him to fight. He does not use his breath weapon until he is bloodied.

If the characters fail the Turning Taloklaxus skill challenge, then the crystal wyrmling fights with every ounce of his ability, coordinating with serpenfolk allies and using his breath weapon as often as possible.

While the characters are fighting Taloklaxus, Varza continues to attack them from afar with damaging spells (acid arrow, magic missle or acide splash). Varza uses venom pool if one or more characters close into melee range or to finish off a seriously wounded character. She resorts to melee only when there is no other option, and happily sacrifices one of her miniojns to keep the characters busy.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> Piled in the back of the cave, the players can find the following: [[wand-of-crackling-lightning-apg|Wand of Crackling Lightning]], [[eclipse-aoa2|Eclipse]], [[heartening-missive-tv|Heartening Missive (Bull)]], [[sovereign-glue-apg|Sovereign Glue]], [[liquid-gold-ooa2|Liquid Gold]] and coin in the amount of 8 gp, 10 sp and 100 cp.

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** Darkness.

**Ceiling:** 20 feet high.

**Corpses:** There are six fresh corpses in the southern end of the chamber. They have all been killed by Taloklaxus and bear wounds one would expect from the teeth, claws, and breath weapon of a crystal dragon. Careful examination of the corpses reveals that three match the descriptions of the missing woodcutters in the Woeful Woodwives hook. Squares with corpses are difficult terrain.

**Dragon Skeleton:** The remains of Karonzaxus lie tumbled in a bony heap against the wall in the southwest corner of the cavern. Her body has been reduced to little more than a skeleton by the adventurers that slew her and the serpentfolk that now reside in her lair. In their haste to butcher their prize, Karonzaxus’s killers left a large number of scales on the crystal dragon’s belly. Although it is a grisly task, the characters can collect enough scales for [[Bergen]]  to work into a shield or suit of armor.

**Rubble:** Squares with rubble are difficult terrain. These piles are large enough to offer cover to adjacent creatures of Medium size or smaller.

**Stream:** This stream is slow-moving, but it is 3 feet deep, which makes it difficult terrain.

# Wrapping Up: Our Very Own Drag on!

[[Pasted image 20230829165718.png|Taloklaxus, Show the Players]]

After the characters defeat Varza, and assuming they succeeded at the Turning Taloklaxus skill challenge, they have the opportunity to gain Taloklaxus as a companion character. At that point, although Taloklaxus no longer considers the characters enemies, he doesn’t yet recognize them as possible allies or friends, either. In fact, the poor wyrmling is in a profound state of emotional turmoil. The recent death of his mother and now the death of the only other creature that has ever been kind to him—even if it was self-serving—has left him confused, depressed, and unsure what to do next. The characters can reassure Taloklaxus and persuade him to join them with a simple complexity 1 skill challenge ([[skills#Diplomacy|Diplomacy]], DC 10, 4 successes before 3 failures).

Normally, a crystal wyrmling would be outside the scope of allowable companion characters; Taloklaxus is a unique case. Bereft of the parental training he would normally receive from his mother and unwilling to fall back on the brutal techniques taught to him by Varza, the wyrmling is a bit of a blank slate. The companion character stat block presented here is modified to reflect this fact. It illustrates how Taloklaxus’s abilities are now stunted because of developmental and emotional trauma.

In any event, it is unlikely that Taloklaxus will remain with the characters as a companion for more than a level or two. He is a dragon, after all, and will recognize soon enough that his destiny lies elsewhere.
