The corrupted lava flows into this room, where the weapons are created and the bulk of the experiments performed. Several duergar work the furnaces with one of Sleed’s imps, preparing another attempt at creating a lava-infused magical weapon. With the noise from hammers, steam, and the roaring furnaces, it’s difficult for them to hear anyone approaching. They expect the sentries to alert them to any potential problems. 

**Encounter Difficulty:** Sample (value xp)
Creatures:
 - 1: [[duergar-guard|Duergar Guard]] G
 - 1: [[imp|Imp]] I

```encounter
name: The Metalworks
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 1: [[Duergar Guard]] 
- 1: [[Imp]]
```

Setup 3 duergar miners (M) 1 imp (I) 1 magma hurler (H) 

The magma hurler starts hidden in the river of lava until its allies are in trouble. Do not place it on the map until it attacks. 

# Another Ambush
If the characters prevented the duergar from escaping the previous room, the entire party gains a surprise round, regardless of which entrance they take; none of the workers are expecting company, and with the level of noise, it’s almost impossible for them to hear the characters arrive. The guard is relaxed and inattentive, while the miners and the imp are focused on the furnaces. Enemies should be set up as shown on the map. 

If one of the duergar managed to escape from the previous encounter and warn his allies in the metalworks, the characters could be walking into a second ambush. The escaped duergar—along with the guard, miners, and imp—will hide behind the furnaces and on either side of the main door, expecting the characters to use the main hallway entrance. Readjust their setup positions to reflect the situation. Characters entering from the hidden doorway will likely enter unnoticed in this scenario, gaining a surprise round. 

If a duergar escaped to the metalworks from the previous encounter, read the following as they near the room: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The always-constant sound of hammers on anvils comes to an abrupt stop, leaving an eerie silence that is soon replaced by loud chatter. 

Regardless of their entrance, read the following when the characters enter the metalworks: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> As you descend deeper into the refinery, you are met with a sudden wall of hot air and ash. The hallway opens up into a giant metalworking facility, which is in surprisingly good condition compared to the rest of the refinery. Stretching toward a tall ceiling of stonework and rock, two giant iron furnaces spout fire and shake violently. Many discarded weapons are scattered around the floor, warped and melted beyond recognition. Near the back of the room is a river of lava, but of a bluish hue, glowing and surging with energy. 

If the characters enter the metalworks unnoticed, read the following: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Several small duergar surround the furnaces, adjusting valves and heating a large sword. An imp rests nearby, floating casually while looking bored. A stout guard leans against one of the walls, his helmet pulled down over his eyes—he looks to be asleep. 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Perception DC 10 The furnaces seem dangerously erratic, spouting fire and the blue lava onto the floor nearby. 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Perception DC 15 The lava flow near the back of the room erupts and splashes with volatile waves. What seems to be a head of molten rock rises above the lava for a second, glaring with fiery eyes before falling back into the channel. 

When the magma hurler appears, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Emerging from the river of lava is an elemental of magma and smoldering rock. 

When a furnace spews lava, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The furnaces shake violently, their metal walls and grates screeching as they strain to hold together. A geyser of lava erupts from inside, throwing flaming slag and magma in every direction.

# Tactics
Regardless of how the battle begins, the imp immediately vanishes and attempts to hide until it sees a good opportunity to attack with tail sting or bite, preferring to flank when possible. If caught in a dangerous position, the imp gives priority to using vanish and retreating rather than attacking. The imp will not hesitate to hover over the lava flow to stay out of a melee character’s reach. 

The guard and miners try to corner the characters near the furnaces, hoping to inflict as much fire damage as possible as the furnaces erupt each turn. The miners have no real tactical prowess but do their best to surround and flank characters when able. The guard uses infernal anger immediately and upon each recharge, saving beard quills for a character who has moved beyond reach. 

Appearing in the most advantageous part of the lava flow, the magma hurler enters combat when either the imp or duergar guard is bloodied or when all three duergar miners are killed, whichever comes first. The magma hurler can stay within the lava flow if within range of the characters but is likely to move out to use magma ball against any characters in a clump.

# Development 
After a quick search of the metalworks, the characters find many piles of warped and useless weapons—remnants of failed experiments—though they can also find the treasure noted below. A DC 12 Arcana check reveals that the bluish lava contains strong magical properties and almost appears to have a life of its own. If the characters are looking for a sample of lava for Ruana, they can obtain it here; Balidor’s brothers, however, are nowhere to be found. 

Although the characters might think they have the element of surprise as they continue, a small fire elemental from the lava flow in the metalworks has already seen and reported the intruders to Sleed, who has started gathering his notes and summoning elemental servitors in preparation for a battle and possible escape. 

# Features of the Area 
**Illumination:** The room is well lit by the furnaces and lava, pulsing with red and blue hues. 

**Elevation:** The ceiling is 30 feet high, made of stonework built into the underside of the rocky terrain. 

**Furnaces:** Each furnace is 10 feet tall, and deals 1d6 fire damage to any creature that enters or begins its turn in one of its squares. At the end of each round, the furnace spews flames and lava, dealing 1d4 fire damage to any creature adjacent to it, which also gains vulnerable 5 fire until the end of its next turn. 

**Lava Flow:** The lava flow is a combination of rock, lava, and magma slowly flowing from the west through a slightly recessed stone channel 5 feet below the floor. A creature falling into the lava takes 1d6 fire damage upon falling in and 1d6 fire damage when starting its next turn in the lava. 

# Treasure 
Scattered among all the worthless items on the floor of the metalworks is one intact level 3 magic weapon.
