The characters continue down another set of stairs and hallways, finally reaching the bottom of the refinery and Sleed’s den, where the corrupted lava broke through the ground and the magical potency is at its peak. Here, Sleed works to perfect his process while Barulg stays nearby to protect him. They have been expecting intruders after hearing the commotion above and have summoned three elemental servitors to assist them in battle.

When the characters enter Sleed’s sanctum, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The sheer heat of this room tells you that you’ve reached the heart of the refinery. Much of the floor’s stonework has been removed, revealing a small fissure. Inside, the strange bluish lava seeps out of the rocks, pulsing as it flows through the channel below into the metalworks. Near the chasm is a trio of small magma elementals, smoldering as they await an order from their master. 
> 
> The corner of the room hides a small imp, who eyes you suspiciously before nodding to a duergar, who approaches carrying an enormous maul. Waves of the corrupted lava seem to flow beneath the metal surface of the hammer, which glows and pulses with a familiar blue hue. “I assume you’ve come for this,” he mocks, gesturing to his weapon. “Don’t worry, you shall have it.”
> 
> **Perception DC 15** Some of the stones have been removed from the floor near the rear of the chamber and been replaced with a small wooden trap door. 
> **Arcana DC 15** The chasm here emanates the strongest magical aura in the refinery and appears to be the source of the lava flow.

# Tactics
With their shared fire resistance, Sleed, Barulg, and the Ember Fox will not hesitate to use the lava chasm to their advantage, running over it and attempting to keep the characters on the other side of it when possible. 

The ember foxes have been summoned by Sleed as protection, so they engage any character that damages or threatens the imp. They intentionally walk in and out of the lava. If Sleed tries to escape, all remaining ember foxes move between the imp and the party to intercept the characters and buy him some time. 

Barulg begins combat by using Take Them Down which affects all his allies unlike the standard version.  He follows with his maul against whichever character he believes to be the biggest threat. Although not extremely intelligent, Barulg is a capable fighter and excels in combat. He will always look to flank targets with the elementals while keeping excellent position. The room is quite small and Barulg will use Hammer Strike when characters bunch up and provide multiple targets.

Sleed’s first priority is to stay alive. He uses vanish immediately and whenever engaged. He uses bite or tail sting only when he has a tactical advantage and room to move. Otherwise, he prefers to hover invisibly above the lava pit and make Arcana checks to trigger the lava’s attack when a character gets too close. Sleed isn’t certain that the characters are strong enough to defeat Barulg and his elementals and won’t stick around to find out if things look bad. He flees immediately when Barulg dies or when all three elementals are defeated. Sleed is clever and will not announce his escape; the imp simply turns invisible and makes a run for it when the characters are disabled or distracted. It’s possible the party won’t notice the devil is gone until after the battle. Sleed intends on using the trap door, but if the characters are aware and seem to be guarding it, the imp heads up the stairs and out of the refinery through the metalworks.

# Development
If Sleed escapes, the characters find charred remnants of notes made in Infernal, which could lead to a future adventure in the Chaos Scar. If decrypted, the notes detail a process for creating powerful elemental servitors even more powerful than the creatures already faced.

If Sleed is captured, he attempts to bargain with the characters for his release. He’s unwilling to give up any information about his masters and their plans but will freely talk about the strange lava and Barulg’s clan. Though the devil in charge is never mentioned, it should be clear that for Sleed and his masters, the refinery was merely a test. 

Found on Sleed’s desk is the treasure. If the characters take time to explore the rest of the chamber, they will discover broken mining picks and light armor bearing the Cragbottom name. The brothers themselves are not here, possibly sacrificed, burned to a crisp, or transferred to another location. That’s up to you to decide. The question of their fate could launch another adventure.

Barulg’s hammer is still intact and can be taken by the characters. Although guardsman Rikter wants to see the weapon as proof of the duergar’s demise, he doesn’t want it, and actually prefers that the characters take it far away. 

# Features of the Area 
**Illumination:** The room is well-lit by lava and torches, but the corners are dim with shadows. 

**Ceiling:** The room has a 10-foot-high ceiling of solid rock. 

**Lava Chasm:** The 4 squares at the center of the chasm contain lava. The surface of the lava is 5 feet below the level of the floor. The 1-square-wide perimeter of rock surrounding the lava is rough stone which acts as difficult terrain. A creature falling into the lava takes 1d6 fire damage upon falling in and 1d10 fire damage when starting its turn in the lava. 

Sleed and Barulg already know how to use the Lava Pit by harnessing the chaotic power of the scar.  Players trained in [[skills#Arcana|Arcana]] had have seen a creature being attacked by the lava can also learn how to control it.

**Trap Door:** A trap door, barely big enough for an imp, leads up to the surface. 

**Sleed’s Desk:** This small wooden desk is covered with charred papers.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> On Barulg is using a [[magma-hammer|Magma Hammer]].  He also carries 9 gp.  Found on and within Sleed's desk the players find another 20 gp, 36 sp, a *Poisonous Dagger* and *Tentacle Potion (Lesser).*
