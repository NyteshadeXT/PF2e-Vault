The only room at ground level, the entryway shows the age of the building; its walls are crumbling and partially collapsed, and with the debris scattered on the floor, each step is uncertain. The duergar intentionally leave the room dark, extinguishing the only two braziers when the scouts spot potential intruders. They prefer to capture any intruders to use as slaves, but their first priority is to deny entrance to the lower levels of the refinery.

The duergar scouts start on the top of the wooden balcony at opposite sides, hiding in the shadows. Do not place them on the map until they attack or a character notices them (see below). 

When the characters enter the refinery, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> As you make your way down a gentle ramp, the air becomes warm and thick and the taste of ash settles on your tongue. A tunnel at the far end of the room glows a pale orange, carrying light and the rhythmic tempo of pounding hammers into the room. Light from the tunnel leaves the walls and corners ominously dark. You can make out a rickety wooden balcony near the rear of the room, which overlooks an uneven stone floor covered with debris and holes. 

Though prepared for intruders, it is possible for the characters to sneak into the room and detect the duergar’s presence before being seen. The scouts have passive [[skills#Perception|Perception]] of 19; if the characters beat it with their [[skills#Stealth|Stealth]] checks, they can enter the room unnoticed. If the characters bring a light source, they are noticed immediately. If they are discovered, the duergar scouts and guards attempt to sneak into advantageous positions (make [[skills#steath|Stealth]] checks for each duergar and compare them to the characters’ passive [[skills#Perception|Perception]] checks). 

The [[skills#Perception|Perception]] check results below assume that the duergar are aware of the characters’ approach and have extinguished the braziers accordingly. If that isn’t the case, the braziers are still lit (see the read aloud text below the [[skills#Perception|Perception]] check results). 

**Perception DC 10** The two braziers flanking the entrance are unlit, but the coals within are slightly warm and glow a faint red—the fires were recently extinguished. 

**Perception DC 15** Between the clanging sounds of metal on metal, you hear the soft, subtle creak of weight on wooden boards. Glancing toward the source of the noise, you see a shadowy figure atop the balcony and the glint of metal in its hand.

If the characters successfully sneak into the room, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> As the rear hallway flickers with fiery light, you can make out the silhouettes of two stout figures standing just inside, their shadows flowing into the room. They don’t seem to be looking in your direction. 

# Tactics 
The duergar start the encounter with two goals in mind: take live prisoners, and keep intruders away from the inner workings of the refinery. They start the fight looking to weaken and capture the characters, but attempt to kill them as soon as they realize the heroes are a significant threat. 

Once combat begins, the duergar guards move into range  of warhammer attacks and making use of infernal anger whenever possible. The guards do their best to keep the characters in the center of the room, allowing the duergar scouts a clear line of sight for their ranged attacks. If still unnoticed, the duergar sharpshooters enter combat a round later, hoping to surprise any characters that have already entered the room.

If the battle is going poorly for the duergar and only two remain, at or near their bloodied values, one of the duergar attempts to flee the room through a secret door atop the balcony, hoping to warn their allies in the adjacent room. If a duergar does make it out alive, add him to the next encounter. 

# Development
If a duergar managed to escape, he runs ahead to alert his allies in the next room, joining them in the second encounter. The escaping duergar assumes that the characters will not be able to find the secret door into the metalworks, and he has set an ambush near the main stairway entrance. The characters can surprise or disorient the ambushers if they take the secret tunnel or split up and approach via both entrances. 

# Features of the Area 
**Braziers:** The braziers can be tipped over with a DC 10 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check, spilling the coals onto an adjacent square and dealing `dice: 1d6` fire damage to any creatures within a close burst 1. 

**Giant Hole:** A creature stepping onto the square drops 10 feet and is knocked prone. 

**Hidden Door:** Located atop the wooden balcony, the door opens into a tunnel leading to the metalworks. A character can discover the door with a DC 15 [[skills#Perception|Perception]] check. 

**Illumination:** The bottom floor is lit by light escaping from the furnace room, which qualifies as dim light. The wooden balcony and most corners are shrouded in darkness. 

**Wooden Balcony:** Elevated 15 feet above the floor, the balcony is sturdy enough to support a lot of weight and any climbing on its sides, but could be brought down if two or more supports are broken, dropping anyone on the balcony to the ground and knocking them prone. Each support has 25 hp, AC 2, and Fortitude 12. 

If a character finds the secret door atop the wooden balcony, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Cleverly disguised as a ventilation shaft, the small door slides open. Peering inside reveals a narrow tunnel, filled with the familiar glow of the nearby furnace room. 

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> If the characters light the braziers, either during or after the fight, they can easily spot some 10 gold and a potion of lesser healing dropped by one of the duergar; otherwise, finding them in the dark requires a DC 10 [[skills#Perception|Perception]] check.
