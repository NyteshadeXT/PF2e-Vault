This is the heart of the Temple of the Radiant Morn, where the cultists conduct their foul rituals in the name of Baalzebul the Fallen One, Lord of Flies. It is also the source of the noxious sludge found throughout the dungeon. 

The otyughs begin in hiding; place the beasts only when the characters spot them. 

Theran, the leader of the temple, appears human when the characters meet him. At the moment when he first takes damage, his illusory appearance dissolves to reveal him for what he is: a charnel otyugh gifted with high Intelligence. When that happens, provide a suitable description of tentacles bursting through clothing, the head reshaping into a gaping maw, and the body swelling into a bloated monstrosity, all accompanied by a burst of terrible stench, questionable fluids, and thousands of biting insects which swarm around him. 

When the adventurers enter the room, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The already nauseating stench becomes even worse as you enter this vaulted cavern. A statue of a gigantic, sluglike creature vomits forth a continual stream of the vile filth which fills this place. Runes surrounding its corroded mouth hurt the eye to look upon. 
> 
> You become aware of a low, humming noise; it is the sound of thousands of buzzing flies! 
> 
> Four cultists wearing tattered, befouled robes chant from the bank of the stream of filth. They are led by a surprisingly handsome human dressed in sumptuous and incongruously immaculate clothing. He turns and says, “We receive more offerings for Baalzebul, our patron. Let the Lord of Maladomini embrace them!” 

**[[skills#Perception|Perception]] Insight Action DC 16:** The character spots the beady eyes and twitching tentacles of an otyugh hiding in the sludge. If at least three characters succeed on this roll, place both otyughs. Characters who succeed on a DC 23 check sense that Theran is not what he appears to be. 

**[[skills#Arcana|Arcana]] or [[skills#religion|Religion]] DC 16:** The character recognizes the name of Baalzebul, one of the Lords of the Nine who rule over the Nine Hells. Known as the Lord of Lies, the Lord of Flies, and (not within his hearing) the Slug Archduke, Baalzebul is a disgustingly, sluglike being of filth that rules the seventh hell, Maladomini. 

# Tactics 
Theran uses only charnel frenzy to attack until he is forced to reveal his hidden nature by taking damage (his aura is always in effect). Once his subterfuge is stripped away, he uses all of his attacks to full effect; charnel lash is especially useful for pulling characters into the sludge. 

Theran expects his cultists to die for him, and they probably will, but he has no such intention for himself. When it becomes apparent that the battle is lost, Theran will do his best to escape, either by rushing down the hideous stream or even squeezing himself up the filth-spewing pipe in the statue. Abandoning his followers to certain doom in order to save his oozing hide is a price he’s willing to pay. 

The orcs may be nearly as surprised by Theran’s transformation as the player characters are, but they don’t pause in their attacks. They push characters into the sludge or within range of the otyughs whenever possible. Each bolt of lightning fills the cavern with the odor of singed muck, and each whirlwind swirls tiny droplets of stinking liquid into the already foul air. These things have no particular effect, but be sure to emphasize how nauseating this encounter is. 

The otyughs lurk in the stream of slime with their squishy bodies flattened beneath the surface. When a target comes within range, they burst from hiding and spend the rest of the encounter trying to drag tasty morsels into the sludge.

# Features of the Area
**Illumination:** Candles, torches, and glowing runes keep the area in bright light. 

**River of Offal:** The stream of stinking liquid counts as difficult terrain to creatures without a swim speed. Creatures other than otyughs in the stream take a -2 penalty to attack rolls, AC, and Reflex; creatures other than otyughs that start their turn in the stream take 5 poison damage. 

**Slug Statue:** Despite the enchantments that keep corruption pouring endlessly from the statue’s mouth, the statue itself has no effect on the encounter besides the mundane attributes common to all statuary.

**Shackles:** Sacrificial victims are kept chained in this chamber until needed. If the characters are looking for the missing trader, Bosco Heldam, they find him here, beaten and unconscious but alive. Otherwise, all the shackles are empty.

# Development 
By the end of this fight, the characters are thoroughly drenched in reeking filth. If they return to town without cleaning up—a task that can take several hours, and they might never get the stench out of some clothing—they will be met with nothing but disgust no matter how successful their expedition was. 

If the characters have not yet defeated encounter 3, then they will find the exit to the dungeon occupied by the false priests and their enthralled parishioners. None of these are particularly loyal to Theran himself, so his demise (or flight) does not concern them; they fight or flee as described in that encounter, with the intention of either claiming the temple for their own use or at least escaping with their lives.
