# Commonly-Heard Rumors 
Anyone who spends time in Restwell Keep will hear that a few months ago, a priest who is a stranger to this region arrived with a small band of followers. They found a cave a few miles from the nearest settlement, cleaned it out, and set up the Temple of the Radiant Morn. They spread a message of salvation and relief from worldly woe which has found wide acceptance. 

After some resistance, the locals have grown accustomed to the presence of the temple and its disciples. Its message is nonthreatening, even comforting. 

# Adventure Hooks

## Limping Johann
A beggar, Limping Johann, approaches the characters to barter something he heard on the street that might be of interest to the adventurers for a stiff drink, a bite to eat, or a few copper coins. If the characters oblige, Johann tells them that “the boys from the temple” have been letting drop that they might know something about ancient treasures lost within the Chaos Scar. If the characters ask him about the temple, Johann refers to them as a bunch of naïve do-gooders, but he can give accurate directions to the Temple of the Radiant Morn in exchange for another small gift. (The rumors of treasure are false. This is a ruse the cultists use to draw victims to the temple. The temple itself does not hold much treasure because up to this time, most of its victims have been poor.) 

## An Unknown Quantity
[[Chendera - Priest, Chapel of Tymora]] is unsettled by the rumors she has heard of a “Temple of the Radiant Morn” springing up within the Chaos Scar. She has never before heard of any such religious group and fears that it could be up to no good, despite its message of charity and brotherly love. What’s more, he has heard from beggars in town that some of their friends who went to the temple “ just for a look” have never come back. That could be nothing—but if the characters find themselves traveling near the temple and have a chance to look into it, he would like to know what’s really going on. Optionally, characters might themselves overhear beggars discussing this situation and swapping theories about the disappearances. 

**Quest XP:** 50 XP for routing or destroying the cult (including Theran) and bringing news of it to Chendera.

## The Missing Merchant
[[Bosco Heldam - Trader]] approaches the characters and tries to hire them as muscle for his “big score.” He confides in them that there’s treasure to be had out at the Temple of the Radiant Morn, and he intends to have it. This information came to him through “reliable channels” which he refuses to share. 

Don’t make the offer too attractive; it should be clear that he’s an amateur who has fallen for a hoax and now has the fever of easy gold. A bit of asking around reveals that this trader has disappeared on similar wild-goose chases before only to come home a few days later, hungry and mud-smeared and vowing never to go adventuring again. Alternatively, the characters might overhear him making the same offer to some other group of bravos or toughs, accompanied by much whispering and looking over his shoulder. 

A week or more after the characters turn him down, his friends or wife approach the characters to ask for help because the merchant has never been gone this long before. The characters could also be approached without ever having seen or heard the merchant, after his disappearance.0

**Quest XP:** 50 XP for bringing the merchant home alive.

# Getting Started
After hearing a few rumors or being approached by NPCs, characters might try to dig up their own information on the Temple of the Radiant Morn by making [[skills#Religion|Religion]] and [[skills#Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] checks. Although the name implies some connection to Lathander, no player character trying a [[skills#Religion|Religion]] check recalls ever hearing of a temple calling itself the Radiant Morn (but be sure to purse your lips and think about this for a moment before announcing the result of the roll). A DC 14 [[skills#Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] check with a [[gather-information|Gather Information]] action, however, finds plenty of locals willing to confirm that the temple’s disciples work to relieve the suffering of the worst off, and a DC 18 check finds one who can give reasonably clear directions to its location. 

When heroes arrive at the temple, read or paraphrase the following: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Ahead of you, the rough mouth of a cave yawns wide to reveal what appears to be the interior of a chapel or temple. Inside, a small crowd of gaunt, unkempt, and generally miserable-looking people kneel on the stone floor or mill about quietly. A pair of white-robed figures moves through them, seemingly offering quiet words of reassurance or sympathetic gestures. Traces of strong, musky incense are carried upon the breeze. 

If the characters stand and watch for more than a few minutes, or when they enter the temple, read or paraphrase the following: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Upon seeing you, one of the robed figures turns and gestures widely, saying “Welcome to the Temple of the Radiant Morn, travelers. Within these walls, solace and understanding are freely given.” You see that the speaker and the other white-robed figure are both male humans.

If the characters ask about the temple or its purpose, the speaker responds: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> “We offer compassion, understanding, and what relief we can from the heavy burdens of this world. The hungry are fed, the weary rested, the grieving counseled, and the ill tended. What is it that you seek?” 

Regardless of how the characters respond, the speaker soon becomes determined to lure them into the next chamber. Read or paraphrase the following: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> “I am afraid my duties are here, tending to those in need. Perhaps you should speak with the head of our order. I am sure he will be glad to help you.” The priest motions for you to follow as he moves toward the doors across the chapel. He sounds a small gong beside the doorway before turning back to you: “Our brothers will meet you within to show you the way.” 

The speaker (Kalin) will not accompany the characters through the doorway. If urged to, he insists that he must stay and attend to the congregation. Kalin sticks to the established story if the adventurers have more questions but always turns the conversation back to meeting the head of the order, Theran. 

Suspicious or wary characters might ask for [[skills#Perception|Perception]] checks with an Insight action while speaking with Kalin. He is a practiced liar; an Insight action or passive [[skills#Perception|Perception]] score of 18 generates the feeling that the priest is not as excited about tending to a crowd of needy beggars as his well-rehearsed speech would indicate. A result of 23 or more reveals that something other than brotherly courtesy may be motivating his insistence on ushering the characters through the doorway. 

If the characters refuse to enter the temple’s inner chamber, confront Kalin for being a liar, or become hostile and aggressive, then the priest excuses himself to whisper briefly with his associate. At that time, the pair turns upon the characters and encounter 3 begins immediately. Otherwise, if the characters advance through the doorway, move ahead to encounter 2.
