The two false priests have moved from comforting the wretched to preaching the message of the Temple of the Radiant Morn. They are weaving the skillful webs of lies so loved by their dark lord, and their audience listens in glassy-eyed rapture. Describe the rest of the scene and alter the read aloud text depending on how the characters arrived at this point in the adventure. Thanks to their paranoia, the two false priests are always on the lookout and won’t be surprised.

Do not place the rot grub swarms at the beginning of the fight; they emerge from hiding only after the struggle is underway. 

When the characters enter, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Gesturing sharply your way, the speaker skillfully weaves your arrival into his speech without missing a stride: “See how the world assails us? The source of your suffering is revealed. Cruel intruders have come to smash our good works and rob us of what little we have! They believe they can take whatever they want with their weapons and their magic! Defend yourselves, oh brothers! Stand up against their greed!” 

# Tactics
The thugs are enthralled by the rhetoric of the false priests and hurl themselves against the characters recklessly until the false priests are both killed, at which point the thugs flee.  

The false priests are happy to use the thugs as shields. They are keenly aware of the braziers’ effect and attempt to keep their foes within it while remaining clear themselves. They are cowards at heart, so once they are below 50% health or all their minions are dead, they become more interested in getting away than continuing the fight. 

The rot grubs appear at the start of the second turn and immediately swarm forward to make the most of their auras. They fight to the death. 

# Features of the Area 
**Illumination:** The braziers, votive candles, and light streaming in through the mouth of the cave provide bright light throughout the area. 

**Braziers:** The thick, musky incense burning in the two braziers is enchanted by the Acolytes of the Radiant Morn to do more than just cover the temple’s stench: a creature within 2 squares of a brazier takes a -2 penalty to Will defense as the fog saps their mental resistance. A creature that moves through a square containing a brazier takes 5 fire damage and the brazier is knocked over. Once knocked over, the square can be navigated safely. A brazier can also be knocked over intentionally as a standard action. This dumps the oil into any square adjacent to the brazier and deals 5 fire damage to any creature occupying that square. 

**Gong:** The gong has no special effect. 

**Pool:** A low wall of stone surrounds the small pool. It counts as difficult terrain and provides cover. 

**Statues:** The statues provide cover and are difficult terrain. 

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> At the base of one of the statues are various offerings: 37gp, 96sp, a Staff of Providence, a Private Workshop and a Singing Muse.

# Development
The worshipers are not evil; most of them are no more than beggars and wanderers who came to the temple seeking food and some kindness. They fight back because they believe that the characters are here to loot their temple. If characters gleefully slaughter these innocents, look for ways to make them regret their cruelty later. You’ll have a prime opportunity if survivors flee back to Restwell Keep with news of an “unprovoked massacre” at the temple.
