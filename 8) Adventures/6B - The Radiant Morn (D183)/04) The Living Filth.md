The vile filth created as both a sign and a byproduct of the cult’s devotion to the slug archduke slowly pooled here, where its corruption and foul magic condensed over time until it imbued the sludge with a terrible semblance of life. Now the cultists use the abomination and the carrion eating aberrations that took up residence to dispose of inconvenient objects or people. 

All of the monsters begin the encounter out of sight, so place them on the battle mat only when the adventurers gain line of sight to them. 

When the characters enter the room, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The air of this cavern is foul from the stagnant river of stinking filth that flows across the chamber. 

Passive Perception 16: The character becomes aware that something lurks in the cavern, without knowing what or where. Characters who are alerted this way can then make active Perception checks against DC 23; place one carrion crawler or the black pudding on the map for each successful check, even if they are out of sight. Make appropriate adjustments for characters who enter the room especially cautiously or recklessly.

# Tactics
The black pudding floats unmoving beneath the surface of the sludge, readying an action until a character wades into or jumps over the pool. At that point, it bursts from the muck to engulf the unfortunate adventurer. From then on, it engulfs and sustains the grab against as many adventurers as possible. Black pudding spawn attack characters at random. 

The giant whiptail centipedes are aware of the black pudding’s hunting methods and stay hidden until the pudding attacks. Then they rush forward along the floor, walls, and ceiling. They are quite fond of using tentacle to strand heroes within the poisonous stream or adjacent to the ooze. They fall back on their bite only when every target within reach is slowed or immobilized. 

# Features of the Area
**Illumination:** Darkness. The only sources of light are those the characters bring with them. 

**Pools of Offal:** The pools and streams of stinking liquid and foul sludge count as difficult terrain to creatures without a swim speed. Creatures other than the black pudding and its spawn in the offal take a -2 penalty to attack rolls, AC, and Reflex. Additionally, creatures that start their turn in the offal take 5 poison damage. Remember that the giant whiptail centipedes can use the walls and ceiling as readily as the floor. 

**Shackles:** The cultists sometimes keep prisoners chained here so they can witness the terrible fate awaiting them when the ooze and giant whiptail centipedes messily consume (or dissolve) other captives. The chains hang empty at this time.
