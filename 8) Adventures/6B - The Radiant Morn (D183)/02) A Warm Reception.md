The characters are ambushed by members of the Temple of the Radiant Morn who were sent to be their escorts. Place only the two storm shamans at first; the reavers are hidden behind curtains and the otyughs are in the offal-filled pit. 

When heroes enter the room, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Two members of the Temple wait for you as promised. As you move into the room, you perceive that the heavy aroma of incense in this chamber masks another, fouler smell. No sooner do you notice that than the white-robed figures throw back their hoods to reveal that they are snarling orcs ready to attack!

If players declared their suspicions before entering this room or are acting in an obviously wary manner, then those with passive Insight of 16 or higher are immediately aware of an unfriendly tenseness within the temple priests and are not surprised. Otherwise, they are surprised. The temple guardians are not surprised. 

Regardless of whether they’re surprised, characters with passive Perception of 16 or higher hear rustling from the alcoves and become aware that something is hidden behind the curtains when initiative is rolled. 

# Tactics
The storm shamans hope to lure rash characters into the pit trap. They begin the fight with their vengeful whirlwinds in an effort to slide characters into the pit, then switch to lightning strikes. 

The reavers use their javelins immediately, also with the goal of pushing characters into the pit or the flaming braziers. 

The otyughs hide within the pit, waiting to attack any hero unfortunate enough to fall in. Once the trap has been sprung, the otyughs also try to grab and pull into the pit any character that moves within reach of their tentacles. Because the pit is 10 feet deep, an otyugh in it can reach only 2 squares outside the pit with its tentacles and can’t bite a target that is outside the pit. An otyugh leaves the pit only if this would be the third round when it has no targets within reach. 

# Features of the Area
**Illumination:** The two braziers provide bright light in the chamber. If both braziers are dumped over, the illumination becomes dim. 

**Curtains:** The curtains concealing the orc reavers block line of sight but do not hinder movement. They can be drawn open or closed with a minor action. 

**Pit of Offal:** A covered pit is hidden near the center of the room. Fragile timbers support flagstones which match the rest of the floor. The pit is 10 feet deep, and its bottom is covered with liquid filth to a depth of about 3 feet. The stinking sludge is difficult terrain for creatures without a swim speed. Creatures other than otyughs in the offal take a -2 penalty to attack rolls, AC, and Reflex, and creatures other than otyughs that start their turn in the offal take 5 poison damage. 

**Statues:** The statues provide cover and are difficult terrain. 

**Braziers:** The two large, shallow braziers are filled with flaming, scented oil. A creature that moves (or is forced to move) into a square containing a brazier takes 5 fire damage and the brazier is knocked over. Once a brazier is knocked over, it no longer has any effect. 

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> In the offal pit PCs can see several items.  PCs who brave the pit can find a *Wand of the Pampered Pet*, a *Wand of Mental Purification (Lesser)* and an *Ice Slick Snare*.

# Development
After this fight, the characters can either head back to the temple entrance (encounter 3) or they can push deeper into the temple (encounter 4; leave encounter 3 for when the characters exit the temple).
