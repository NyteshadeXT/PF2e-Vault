# Background 
A few months ago, drawn by the whispers of dark power and the opportunity presented by the suffering of those living near the Scar, a devotee of Baalzebul known to his ilk as Theran of the False Truth moved into the Chaos Scar with a small band of cultists. Once situated in an abandoned cave, they set up the fake “Temple of the Radiant Morn” and began spreading a message of salvation from the anguish and terrible burdens of the world. Their message was tailored to appeal to the grief-stricken, the suffering, the outcast, and those with nothing to lose. While a few have found the relief and sympathy promised, they are but another means for the cult to propagate its lies, for in reality the temple is a web of deceit designed to spread the Lord of Lies’ influence and lure a steady stream of victims who will not be missed to their dooms. 

By now, the temple has established itself as a local institution. In an effort to widen its net from the poor and disenfranchised and draw in more powerful victims, devotees have begun spreading whispers of lost treasures and forgotten lore uncovered in the Scar. This, they hope, will attract adventurers, wandering scholars, itinerant merchants, and anyone else whose disappearance won’t raise much suspicion.
