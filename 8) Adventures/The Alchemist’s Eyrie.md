# Background
Durzh is—well, was—a renowned dwarven alchemist who hailed from a nearby dwarven stronghold. Paranoid, surly, and antisocial, Durzh was nonetheless one of the most brilliant minds the dwarves had in the realm of alchemy.

The Alchemist’s Eyrie centers on a tower built by and for Durzh by his people. Here, in relative seclusion, Durzh was able to perform research and develop his strange concoctions, undisturbed by the noise and earthshaking industry common in large dwarven underground cities. Since his research and wares were very valuable to the dwarves, he was given a garrison of soldiers to guard the fort, although they had to abide by his rather strict rules of conduct.

Recently, Durzh worked on a remedy for a contagious illness that had been plaguing his home stronghold. Through the effects of his medicinal potions, the disease was contained and thought to be cured. The dwarven healers were wrong, however; the disease was merely contained. It has now broken out again, and the stronghold needs more medicine to distribute among the populace to put an end to this illness for once and for all.

Sadly, Durzh’s fame has become widely known. A variety of merchants drop by his tower from time to time to barter for his wares. They then transport these throughout the land. As Durzh’s fame spread, the rumors of his wares and his cures for illness eventually reached the evil ears of a group of [[stone-giant|Stone Giant]].

The clan these giants belong to is suffering from an obscure disease. They came to Durzh in the dead of night with magic disguising them as dwarves and assaulted the tower. They slaughtered the guards, captured Durzh, and demanded that the alchemist help them. They wanted him to find a cure for the disease. He refused, and was slain.

Enter the characters.

# Adventure Hooks
There are several possible ways to pull your players into this adventure.

**Aiding the Sick:** The dwarves of Bhal Doral send the players as messengers to tell Durzh what they need and when they need it, but when they arrive at the tower, they find Durzh in no condition to fulfill the order. Also, since Bhal Doral is a large stronghold, the characters can purchase pretty much anything they desire. If the PCs need one, the dwarves will loan them a donkey to transport the medicine back. The pay for returning with medicine is 100 gp apiece; the price is this high because the dwarves expect the characters to push themselves hard day and night to be as timely as possible. (Due to great precautions taken by the dwarves, there is no chance that the characters contract the plague.)

## Other Background Information
Characters who have dealt with Durzh directly or who have dealt with merchants who buy from him might already know some of the facts given below. Otherwise, if the PCs try to glean additional information from the dwarves of the stronghold using [[skills#Society|Society]] checks, they can learn the following facts about the dwarf and his tower:

**DC 5:** Durzh is an expert alchemist. He lives in a tower built for him near the top of a waterfall.

**DC 10:** Durzh is somewhat of a loner, preferring to be away from the stronghold to do his work. Thus the tower had to be designed to be defensible and self-sufficient.

**DC 15:** The dwarves in the tower are somewhat paranoid; don’t be surprised if you get a rude welcome, at least initially. The tower is equipped with water-powered machinery and houses about ten dwarves.

**DC 20:** The tower is extremely defensible, equipped  with four ballistae around the walls and a fifth in a turret on top. There is no direct access into the tower other than through the main doors. Durzh worked alone, locked up in his subterranean lab; he trusted no one else to enter.

**DC 25:** Durzh is very paranoid, even of his own people, and hired some of the best dwarven engineers to work on the tower. Expect traps, even in places that should be clear of obstacles.

**DC 30:** Oh, yeah—don’t be offended if they don’t invite you in for an ale. Some of you folk are pretty tall, and rather than make you stoop, they’ll greet you outside.

# DURZH’S TOWER
The following text describes the environment in which The Alchemist’s Eyrie takes place.

![[The Alchemist’s Eyrie-20240321224206418.webp]]

## Outside & Approaching
**Encounter Difficulty:** Moderate (80 xp)

Read or paraphrase the following when the characters first see the tower:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Your destination is a solid-looking circular fortress, perched on lichen-covered rock not too far from the top of a rather steep slope. A raging mountain river flows swiftly by to the northwest, passing close to the tower and then tumbling down into the ravine below with a thunderous roar. A mist constantly rises from the gorge, proudly displaying a rainbow in the bright sun.
> 
> As you get closer, you see that the so-called “tower” is solidly built. In fact, it rather reminds you of a dwarf: short, wide, and unlikely to get knocked down. Only a dwarf would consider something so short to be a tower. It is no more than 30 feet high and some 60 feet or so across at the base. The top of the tower is covered by a stone roof armored with spikes, and capped by what appears to be perhaps an observation post. Small archer-slit windows are set around the periphery, and a stair rises to the entrance, which faces the southwest. 
> 
> There are couple of dwarves are working outside the main entrance. One of them sees you approaching and points, apparently speaking with his companions.

The creatures outside are two of the main body of the giants. At first glance, they appear perfectly normal. They are typical dwarves, wearing somewhat baggy clothes and chain shirts, with dwarven-made axes tucked in their belts or slung over their shoulders on straps. The giants are taking care of (read: perpetrating unspeakable crimes upon) five of the dwarves they killed when taking over the tower, but they feign innocence when the party approaches. The giant who speaks for the party claims they are a group of merchants, here to barter medicinal herbs (and knowledge of how to use them) for some of Durzh’s famous potions. When they arrived, they found the tower in this state. They are tending to the dead while their leader tries to ascertain who would do such a thing. It is possible that the culprits are still inside.

The dwarven corpses show a mix of clean-edged wounds (from axes) and deep bruises, (from punches). If a ranger or druid attempts to track, little can be found on the lichen-covered rock, although a [[skills#Survival|Survival]] check (DC 25) will show that there was no combat outside the tower.

If the characters look around, they can see a collection of crossbows near the steps leading up to the door. Several dwarven bodies lie about (having been dragged to their current positions). One of the bodies has been flayed open (by a couple of angry giants). And, on the steps by the front door, is the corpse of a strangely stony skinned creature, mostly melted and definitely not readily identifiable. This last is a giant who was liberally doused with acid from a dwarf inside the tower (see [[#Area 10 Artillery Room]]).  The giants are concerned that he did not return to normal upon his death.

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 2: [[stone-giant|Stone Giant]]

```encounter
name: Outside & Approacthing
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 2: [[Stone Giant, Dwarven Warrior]] 
```

If the characters seem suspicious, they can try to penetrate the wererats’ disguises. A [[sense-motive|Sense Motive]] check reveals the fllowing information, depending on the check result:

**DC 12:** The "dwarves" are not merchants at all (they have none of the accoutrements one might expect).

**DC 18:** The "dwarves" care nothing for the dwarves and have no altruistic intent.

**DC 25 (20 for a dwarf ):** The "dwarves" reveal some subtle but noticeable un-dwarven like behavior, perhaps in the way they hold or carry their axes.

DC 30: A character see the anomalies in the chain shirts the "dwarves" wear; the giants explain their armor by claiming to have foolishly patronized a one-size-fits-all armorer. Characters also notice some small but revealing aspect of the giants, perhaps slightly stony texture to their skin or pale iris' of a stone giant.

### Tactics
The giants hope to gently usher the party into the tower, offering to show the characters the damage they found, meet their leader, search for the medicine the party needs, and so forth. If the characters go inside the tower, the giants follow them in, pick up heavy crossbows as they enter the tower, and spring an ambush, trapping the PCs between themselves and a compatriot and the gang’s impish advisor, currently inside.

If the characters figure things out and attack the giants outside, the foes fight aggressively. One tries to make it inside the tower to warn the others. While fighting, the giants try to get to their crossbows. Failing a way to do that, they have no fear of wading into melee with their axes.

The giants are a little concerned about their identity getting out; that’s why they attacked at night. However, if a "dwarf" loses one-quarter of its hit points to damage, its skin takes on a stony texture and all of it's hair falls out revealing a small stone giant.

Remember that the giants are intelligent, and treat them as such. However, to the characters’ advantage (just as it was to the advantage of the giants a few hours ago), the sound of the waterfall prevents the noise of battle from alerting those still inside.

![[The Alchemist’s Eyrie-20240321224110675.webp]]

# Area 1: Entryway
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The main gate to the dwarven tower is no more than 8 feet high, but each door is also close to 5 feet wide. As you enter, a single reinforced door to the north hangs open. It shows damage from axes and stone litter the floor, but it was not forced open.  In front of the door is a spiked pit almost 5 feet wide and 10 feet long. The pit was covered by a stone slab, but that slab has been pulled back into the wall, exposing it. At the bottom of the pit lies some sort of humanoid wearing chainmail, fatally pierced through various parts of the body. The corpse is not easily identifiable and  climbing down into the spiked pit appears to be a dangerous endeavor

The first room inside is a very nasty kill-zone. There is an archer slit in the rear wall and the right-side wall, and a single reinforced door to the north. 

Players may notice the many very pointy spikes of various heights in the open pit, leaving no place to put your feet. The giants, of course, discourage any investigation into the identity of the corpse.

> [!warning]
> If the characters make any noise as they pass through here, the goblin in the pantry (area 7) notices their passage and prepares an ambush. If the characters enter in the company of the wererats outside, one of the villains ensures the imp notices their passage.

Characters must jump across the pit ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] DC 16) to get in; the giants falsely claim that they tried to close the cover, but it was stuck fast.

# Area 2: Office
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> This room has been trashed.  A once nice table is now smashed in the corner of the room.   A pool of blood and a broken crossbow can be found next to the remains of the table. Chairs are scattered about, some broken, others in good shape.

This room was once where the dwarves would meet with caravan merchants and make their deals.  In the corner to the north is a dumbwaiter with two counterweighted boxes. This device allows the dwarves to quickly move supplies from the supply level to the outside, and vice versa. The interior of the dumbwaiter chimney is smooth and narrow. Anyone the size of an elf or smaller can descend inside the chimney by making a [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check (DC 20). If the check fails, the character falls 20 feet to the bottom of the shaft. The dumbwaiter’s boxes are 2 feet on a side, too small to contain any characters. The dumbwaiter cannot handle a load of more than 70 pounds. Any heavier, and the bottom breaks out and the contents fall to the bottom of the shaft.

# Area 3: Gate Defense
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> This area is the secondary line of defense for the tower, where the dwarves hope to injure or kill those who have made it past the main gate. There is an archery slit here, and a couple of poles with hooks lie on the floor. The hooks are used to pull back the cover of the spiked pit; when fully closed, the cover pokes six inches under this wall and has two holes. 

A pair of dwarves can use the hooked poles to yank the cover back. Two of the tower’s former occupants did, and succeeded in catching one giant off guard.

# Area 4: Common Room
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Relatively untouched by the combat, this area looks for all the world like the interior of any dwarven tavern.  Sturdy, rough-hewn tables and chairs are scattered about. There is a fireplace in the northeast corner. The last fire in it has been out for several hours.

The feel of this room is what made the dwarven garrison feel most at home.

A [[skills#Perception|Perception]] check (DC 20) enables a character to notice that the second step down from this level to the barracks level is a different color from the other steps. This is not a trap; that particular step cracked and was recently replaced... but the PCs don’t know that.

# Area 5: Dining Room 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Also untouched, this area has a large, round table surrounded by eight seats. Various stains cover the walls.  Along the wall adjoining the kitchen is a set of shelves filled with plates, mugs, bowls, and eating utensils. A name written in graphite on the shelves marks each person’s stuff.

Although twelve dwarves lived in the tower, there are only eight chairs her; any fighter instantly realizes this is because some dwarves must remain on watch. Various stains on the wall indicate the dwarves would occasionally have food fights when overcome with boredom or ale.

The shelves along the wall are all very soldierly, which basically means that no one else but the owners would want to touch them. A box at the end of one of the shelves holds the dining utensils of the sergeant of the guard; while these are nicer than the other implements here, they are a far cry from fine china. Anyone who looks for Durzh’s utensils here, and can read Dwarven, realizes they are not here (they are in his library).

> [!warning]
> If the players have accompanied the giants in here, this is where the will spring the ambush.  Their sergeant Gnash from [[#Area 6 Kitchen]] will join the combat in the second round if he was not notified by the goblin or in the first if he was.

# Area 6: Kitchen
**Encounter Difficulty:** Moderate (90 xp)

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Against the northwest portion of the wall is a set of shelves holding a great variety of pots and pans. The wall adjoining the dining room is where the oven and stove are. The last fire in the oven has been out for several hours.

The dwarven giant sergeant Gnash is in here, rummaging through the various items looking for anything of interest. Not that there is—it’s a dwarven kitchen. Dwarves aren’t very good cooks, at least not in the opinion of any nondwarf.

Players investigating the oven discover a clever venting arrangement lets smoke seep outside without weakening the defensibility of the tower.

If a character enters, Sgt. Gnash immediately attacks, calling for help from the goblin in the next room.
 - 1: [[stone-giant-elite|Sgt. Gnash]] W
 - 2: [[goblin-archer|Goblin Archer]] H

```encounter
name: Kitchen
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 1: [[Stone Giant Elite, Sgt. Gnash]] 
- 2: [[Goblin Archer]]
```

#  Area 7: Pantry
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Filled with small amounts of various dried meats, grains, spices, and other such cooking stuff, this room has nothing to offer the adventurer... except maybe the small archery slit leading into the entryway.

There is nothing of particular value here, and much of what is here has already been poisoned by the aforementioned goblins.

![[The Alchemist’s Eyrie-20240321224136216.webp]]

# Area 8: Water Closet
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The dwarves living here have incredible luxury by adventuring standards. Each of these rooms has a primitive flush toilet and a sink, as well as a bar of high-grade soap (manufactured by the resident alchemist).

# Area 9: Machinery and Plumbing
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> This area houses the water-powered machinery and piping for the tower. 

A large part of this machinery is designed to provide power to the turret on top of the tower. The rest of it pumps and provides water to the various bathrooms. On the main level, overhead pipes also bring water to the kitchen, and a floor drain takes wastewater back.

The machinery is not entirely closed off; mechanics needed to be able to access this area to perform maintenance. There are a few small crawlways on each level, but no one larger than a dwarf can crawl in more than a few feet. Dwarves and smaller creatures can laboriously make their way all through the tower machinery.

# Area 10: Artillery Room 
**Encounter Difficulty:** Trivial (40 xp +30 if the dwarf is saved)
This is the main defensive area of the tower, and as such, it has a trap in the stairwell to help prevent its capture if someone breaches the main gate.

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> This room is open with a circular stairway in the center heading upward. Four ballistae occupy the compass points for all-around defensive fire. These ballistae are mounted on universal joints attached to the very front of each device, so that they can swivel freely yet still fire through a very small archery slit. Casks of tar and oil sit by the fireplace, along with a pair of small cauldrons to transport boiling tar across the level.  A dwarf lies slumpped near the fireplace. To the southeast is a rack of weapons holding everything from polearms to axes to crossbows. Crates of ballista bolt clips are stacked by the water machinery next to the stairwell. 
> 
> An open window with a sluice hangs over the main gate. This feature is designed to make it easy for defenders to pour everything from flaming oil to boiling tar to acid on any attackers. The sluice ensures that the liquid sprays liberally on the tower’s front porch instead of dribbling down the walls. A few casks of oil and a pair of empty glass jugs are nearby.

The stairwell continues up from here to the turret, which is a small cramped affair armed with another ballista. There is barely enough room up here for a gunner and an assistant; the gunner aims and fires the ballista, while the aide rotates the turret using a series of levers and helps load the ballista. The turret mechanism has been sabotaged and is not operational.

> [!danger]+ Trap
> The top stair of the stairwell is a pressure trap ([[skills#Stealth|Stealth]] DC 25, [[skills#Thievery|Thievery]] DC 27). If someone steps on it without having pressed the safety (just around the corner of the stairwell on the main floor, out of sight),  [[yellow-mold|Yellow Mold]] sprays from above. Anyone standing on the stair or within 5 feet of it can make a Reflex save (DC 30) to leave the area of effect. Otherwise, the character suffers Yellow Mold poisioning.

A critically injured dwarf named Eilif (1st level Fighter), breathing heavily, lies slumped against the wall near the fireplace, where embers still burn. He was the one who dumped the acid on the attacking giant, in return for which a lucky crossbow shot pierced his lung fired by another giant who slipped through the window. Knowing the tower had fallen, he sabotaged the turret, then spread oil across the floor and prepared to set fire to it as soon as anyone entered the room.

Eilif is borderline delirious. If someone triggers the yellow mold trap, he awakens and sets fire to the oil. If not, characters entering the floor must make a [[skills#Stealth|Stealth]] check (DC 20) to avoid waking him.

If the oil is fired, characters can beat a hasty retreat and avoid any serious damage, although the blaze will ruin the ballistae, weapons, and ammo, as well as kill the dwarf. If the characters manage to save the dwarf (by whatever means), award an extra 30 experience points to the party.

![[The Alchemist’s Eyrie-20240321224037619.webp]]

# Area 11: Cloakroom
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> As you come around the stairs you find four more dwarven bodies.  The area around the stairwell is surrounded by curtains, which appear to separate individual rooms from common areas. Toward the west is a water drain and a pair of coat racks; where the dwarves could hang their gear.

If the players search the bodies they find a key on a successful [[skills#Perception|Percepton]] check (DC 18).  The key is to the [[#Area 14 NCO’s Quarters]]

# Area 12: Bunk Room
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> This is a standard dwarven bunk room. Each room has two beds, a pair of footlockers, and a table with two chairs. 

The footlockers have all been plundered.

# Area 13: Occupied Bunk Room
**Encounter Difficulty:** Trivial (30 xp if the dwarf is rescued)

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Another standard dwarven bunk room. Each room has two beds, a pair of footlockers, and a table with two chairs. 

This room is like every other bunk room, except that a panicked dwarf named Snurry is hiding in the rear. As soon as anyone enters the room, he attacks. If killed, he is not worth any experience points; however, the characters can earn 30 experience points if they succeed in calming him down. He is panicked, though not unreasonable, and will join with the party to help if requested.

[[dwarven-caravan-guard|Snurry]]

```encounter
name: Occupied Bunk Room
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 1: [[Dwarven Caravan Guard, Snurry]] 
```

# Area 14: NCO’s Quarters
The door to this room is locked ([[skills#Thievery|Thievery]] DC 21). 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Inside is a well-furnished room for a low-ranking dwarven military officer and head merchant. It has a nice bed, a desk, journals, maps, dressers, and a private table with candelabra. Some of the journals are mercantile ledgers, showing which items have been bought and sold by the tower denizens over the last twenty years or so.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> The candelabra is of fine quality (worth 5 gp), and in one of the dresser drawers is a small bag containing a gold necklace with a pendant emblazoned with a dragon (valued at 30 gp).

#  Area 15: Washroom
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> This area appears to be a washroom.  It contains two primitive toilets and sinks, as well as a nice shower.

The shower is dwarven sized and utilizes icy mountain stream water.

![[The Alchemist’s Eyrie-20240321224021990.webp]]

# Area 16: Storeroom
**Encounter Difficulty:** Severe (120 xp)

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> This open area houses a bunch of supplies for the tower. Foodstuffs, ale, water, linen, maintenance materials: It’s all here, arranged neatly and clearly labeled (in Dwarven). 

Valuable goods are stored in the cage ([[#Area 17 The Cage]]). A secret door in the northeast corner ([[skills#Perception|Perception]]) DC 25) leads to the alchemy stores ([[#Area 18 Alchemy Stores]]).

> [!danger]+ Trap
> There is a magic trap on the third step of the stairwell descending down from this level to the bottom level ([[skills#Stealth|Stealth]] DC 25, [[skills#Thievery|Thievery]] DC 25).  If sprung, the trap summons a pair of [[stone-mauler|Stone Maulers]] to attack the party. 

```encounter

party: Chaos Scar
creatures:

# Area 17: The Cage
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> You see a steal cage with boxes and casks stacked within.

This is a locked ([[skills#Thievery|Thievery]] DC 18) steel-bar cage in which the finished the alchemical goods are stored. Currently there are twenty-two boxes in the combustibles portion, nine boxes in the grenades area (carefully packed in straw), and two casks in the corner. If opened, these contain:

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> Three boxes containing six [[thunderstone|Thunderstone (Moderate)]] each
> Two boxes of six [[alchemists-fire|Alchemist's Fire (Moderate)]] each
> Ten boxes of twenty-four [[tindertwig|Tindertwig]] each
> Seven boxes of twelve [[sunrod|Sunrod]] each
> Five boxes of twelve [[smokestick|Smokestick]] each
> Four boxes of six [[tanglefoot-bag|Tanglefoot Bag]] each
> Two casks of acid (sixteen [[acid-flask|Acid Flask (Moderate)]] worth )
> 
> There is also a strongbox ([[skills#Thievery|Thievery]] DC 21) that opens with the same key used for the door to the NCO’s quarters. It holds roughly 10 gp.

# Area 18: Alchemy Stores
**Encounter Difficulty:** Severe (120 xp)

This is where Durzh keeps his raw materials. There is a lot of wildly varied stuff in here: iron filings, alum, pure vinegar, weak acids and bases, and all sorts of concoctions that only an alchemist would be interested in. There are also containers of insects, worms, and a slough of anatomical bits dissected from various creatures, everything from a cat’s tongue to bat ears to strips of the intestine of a destrachan. There is a single sprig of belladonna.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> Included among all this stuff are the raw materials required for the medicine that Durzh brewed. If these are returned to the dwarves along with the recipe found in his library ([[#Area 20 Library]]]), the stronghold’s alchemists can reproduce the medicine.
> 
> There is also a set of glass jars that contain the following: seven pearls valued at 10 gp each, 20 gp worth of ruby dust, 9 gp worth of jade dust, 35 gp worth of diamond dust, and 40 gp worth of powdered amber.

> [!danger]+ Trap
> Among the various containers is a large box that has two living Aurumvorax inside. If they make a [[skills#Perception|Perception]] check of DC 15, they sit very quietly until their box is opened.

# Area 19: The Lab
**Encounter Difficulty:** difficulty (xxx xp)

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> This is where Durzh did his work. The entire area is filled with tubes, glassware, and assorted bizarre machinery. The mechanical contraptions in the center of the room allow for the automatic stirring, shaking, and agitation of various experiments. Much of the equipment has been damaged.

Bloodbeard, the leader of the dwarven giants, is here, as is Speenar the Unlucky, their resident gnome rogue. Bloodbeard is in the library leafing through texts, while Speenar peruses the lab looking for anything particularly valuable.

 - 1: [[dwarven-warpriest|Bloodbeard]] 
 - 1: [[gnome-arcane-sneak|Speenar]] 
 - 1: [[stone-giant|Dwarven Brute]]

```encounter
name: EncounterName
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 1: [[Dwarven Warpriest, Bloodbeard]] 
- 1: [[Gnome Arcane Sneak, Speenar]]
- 1: [[Stone Giant, Dwarven Brute]]
```

### Tactics
Bloodbeard starts battle with protection (good). He then casts silence on a likely looking spellcaster, followed, if time permits, by agonizing despair on a tough-looking fighter. Then, being the fearless giant dwarf that he is, he wades in with his +1 light hammer and starts killing. Bloodbeard fights to the death.

Speenar enjoys using his true strike spell to prepare a sneak attack. If things are going badly for Speenar, he runs for Durzh’s Lookout (area 22), jumps out the window, and casts invisibility and disappears into the waterfall’s mist. If he does survive an attack in this manner, he can plague the characters for a long time to come.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> Barring a real nasty fight in this area, there is enough salvage here for someone to piece together an alchemist’s lab.  Bloodbeard has a +1 [[striking|Striking]] light hammer +1 [[resilient|Resilient]] scale mail and a wooden shield.  Speenar has a +1 [[striking|Striking]] [[frost|Frost]] short sword and +1 leather armor.

# Area 20: Library
This area has a set of shelves and a desk, complete with a pauper’s set of dirty dishes. Durzh keeps his alchemical library and all his personal records here. Characters who take items from Durzh’s library and study them gain a +1 bonus on all future [[skills#Crafting|Crafting (Alchemy)]] checks.

Among the books in the library is **Durzh’s book of medicinal recipes**. If the characters return this book, along with some ingredients from the alchemy stores ([[#Area 18 Alchemy Stores]]), the dwarven alchemists back at the stronghold can recreate Durzh’s work.

# Area 21: Durzh’s Room
Durzh has a set of three doors to provide a sound baffle between the lab and his bedroom. The third door is trapped with a crossbow trap ([[skills#Perception|Perceptoin]] DC 27, [[skills#Thievery|Thievery]] DC 30).

The interior of the room is a typical ascetic mad scientist’s lair: messy, stinky, disorganized. A full search of the room turns up only one item of interest: a carved ivory plaque valued valued at 20 gp. 

# Area 22: Durzh’s Lookout
At other times, when his mood was good, Durzh would go here to gaze out at the outside world. An armored shutter here can be closed and locked, but at the moment it is open. It is through this open window that Bloodbeard and Speenar found their way into here.

Visible here is a long smear of blood, the last sign left by Durzh as his body was dragged to the window to be thrown out.

# Area 23: Spillway
This very loud, very wet area opens onto the underside of the waterfall. A set of complex waterwheels and pipes here supplies the entire tower with power and water. Fighting here is extremely dangerous, and the details thereof are left to the Dungeon Master. Also note that the noise means all spells with verbal components have a 10% chance of failure.

# Ending the Adventure
The stronghold provides the characters the agreed upon 100 gp as compensation for their efforts. They will not agree to increase the reward as they claim the rest of the money must be used to help brew the medicine. However, since Durzh was not a family dwarf, the party is welcome to keep whatever plunder they found. If the characters object, the dwarves remind them that legally, the tower and its contents are the property of the dwarven stronghold, and if the characters surrender all the plunder they found on stronghold grounds, they can receive additional payment of another 100 gp.

The characters may also attempt to brew the medicine themselves but there is simply not enough time for the characters to succeed. The plague progresses, and the stronghold intends to put all of their best alchemists on the job. If the characters try, it will take too long, and the dwarves know it.
