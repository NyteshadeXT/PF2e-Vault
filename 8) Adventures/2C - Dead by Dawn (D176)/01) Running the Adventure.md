# Adventure Hooks 
**Farian's Fee**
Farian Blackhand, a mercenary and scoundrel, asks the characters to enter the Chaos Scar and locate a group of mercenary adventurers called Doran’s Daggers. Farian fears that Doran and his group have met a bad end, and since Farian has not been paid for his last job with the Daggers, he asks the characters to find Doran Underhelm, dead or alive, and collect the 100 gp owed to him. Farian tells the characters that Doran often carries large sums of coin and gems on his person, and since the mercenary leader is likely dead, the characters can keep whatever they find on his corpse, less what is owed to Farian. However, if Dorian is alive and the characters can collect Farian’s fee, he agrees to split it with them. Doran can be identified by a tattoo of crossed axes on his left forearm.

Farian believes Doran’s Daggers set out to explore an abandoned temple they discovered on a previous excursion into the Chaos Scar. If the characters agree to help him, Farian can tell them exactly where it is.

**Pit Stop**
Use this hook after the characters finish an adventure within the Chaos Scar. While traveling through a small forest on their way out of the Chaos Scar, the characters stumble upon the temple of Orcus late in the day. Should they decide to explore the temple, they quickly lose track of time, and before they know it, the sun is setting and ominous moaning and shuffling noises fill the forest beyond the temple walls…

Read or paraphrase the following when the characters reach the temple of Orcus: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The trees of the forest suddenly give way to a large, bare clearing dominated by a weed-choked temple. Its peaked roof, festooned with demonic gargoyles, is largely intact, although its windowless walls are cracked and crumbling. The main entrance to the temple, two mammoth, ironbound doors, yawn open, exposing nothing but darkness beyond. Although obviously abandoned and in disrepair, the structure exudes a quiet malevolence made all the more haunting by the waning light of the setting sun
