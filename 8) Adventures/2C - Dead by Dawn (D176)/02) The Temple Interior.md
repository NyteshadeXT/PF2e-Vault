When the characters enter the temple, it is late in the day and the sun is setting. Allow the characters to explore the temple interior and the rectory beneath it during the last few minutes of daylight. 

When the characters enter the temple interior, read: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> You step from the fading sunshine into the surprisingly cold darkness of the temple interior, gloomy and shrouded in shadow. The templeâ€™s floor is smooth, polished stone. The ceiling has collapsed in some areas and littered the ground with fallen debris, and in one section, the floor has collapsed, leaving an open pit. The interior walls feature fading murals depicting scenes of butchery, cannibalism, and other profane acts. The temple is divided into two sections by a row of tall, ornate bookshelves filled with crumbling scrolls and tomes. In addition, you notice a number of egresses beyond the main door, and two sets of smaller doors along the eastern and western walls. 

The murals depict scenes of the Abyss. In addition to the demons in the murals, various types of undead are prominently depicted. Characters studying the mural closely see hints of an older, even more faded mural beneath the existing one. This older mural depicts scenes of vibrant cities; robed, stern-faced clerics preaching to a rapt audience of half-naked savages; diplomatic negotiations presided over by more robed clerics; and in the center of it all, a tall, statuesque woman in blue and silver. Characters who make a DC 10 [[skills#Religion|Religion]] check correctly identify these images as iconography of the church of Waukeen. 

The older mural is more than a simple depiction of events and images important to the faithful of Waukeen. The mural contains clues to the location of an old treasure cache containing items that could prove immensely helpful to the characters later in the adventure. Finding this cache requires two successful DC 15 [[skills#Perception|Perception]] or [[skills#religion|Religion]] checks by a character or characters who seek a deeper meaning in the faded mural devoted to Waukeen. If the characters are successful, they discover the location of the hidden cache behind the statue of Orcus at the northern end of the temple (see Features of the Area). 

When the characters reach the northern end of the temple interior, read the following: 

> [!warning]
> This end of the temple is similar to the other, save it is dominated by a massive statue of a horrid demon. The floor around the statue is stained with the rust-colored patina of old blood. The statue is flanked by a pair of huge braziers, each standing five feet high. 

It should be obvious to the characters the statue is a representation of Orcus, Demon Lord of Undeath. A DC 15 [[skills#Perception|Perception]] check reveals that the statue is a more recent addition to the temple. The crumbling base of another statue is barely visible beneath the current one. 

# Features of the Area 
**Illumination:** The temple interior is unlit, although sunlight from the doorway filters through and fills the main chamber with dim light. 

**Ceiling:** The ceiling in this area is 30 feet high. 

**Book Shelves:** Each bookshelf is 10 feet high, constructed of thick hardwood, and holds scrolls and books on the subjects of demonology, undeath, and other unsavory subjects. A character can climb on top of a bookshelf with a DC 15 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check. 

**Braziers:** If lit, the two large braziers provide bright illumination out to 8 squares. The two smaller ones provide bright illumination out to 4 squares. 

**Debris:** Squares with debris are considered difficult terrain. 

**Doors:** Including the main doors, there are two sets of doors along the east and west wall, for a total of five doors in all. All the doors are jammed except the main doors, swelled and rusted with age. Opening one of these doors requires a DC 15 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check. 

**Pit:** The pit is 10 feet deep. Climbing into and out of the pit requires a DC 10 [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] check. 

**Smaller Statues:** The two smaller statues along the east and west walls depict a male and female demon, winged and horrible. Creatures adjacent to a statue have cover. A character making a DC 10 [[skills#Perception|Perception]] check notices that the statues have been repurposed, and were once depictions of the goddess Waukeen and what was likely a cleric or paladin in her service. 

**Sarcophagi:** A sarcophagus is difficult terrain that provides cover. Both sarcophagi are empty, having long ago been plundered. 

**Trapdoor:** The trapdoor opens easily and leads to the temple rectory. 

# Treasure
Behind the great statue of Orcus, hidden in a hollow beneath a loose stone in the floor, lies a cache of holy items secreted by the faithful of Waukeen long ago. If the characters succeeded at the Perception or Religion checks from examining the mural of Waukeen, they learn the exact location of the cache. If they failed the skill checks, they might still find the cache of items after The Siege Begins encounter (page 31). The cache contains four vials of holy water (level 1) and two potions of healing (lessor).
