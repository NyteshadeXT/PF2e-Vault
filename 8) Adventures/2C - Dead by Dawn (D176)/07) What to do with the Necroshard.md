The characters could simply leave the necroshard in the temple, but its power would continue to grow, and eventually an unstoppable horde of zombies would sweep out of the Chaos Scar and into civilized lands. This is certainly reason enough to destroy it. However, if certain precautions are taken, the power of the necroshard can be harnessed and used by the characters. 
# Destroying the Shard
If the characters decide to destroy the necroshard, they find it is almost impervious to attacks. However, surviving the zombie horde earns them the favor of Erathis, especially if one or more characters managed to beseech aid from the goddess during the zombie siege. A simple DC 10 Religion check grants the characters divine insight on how the necroshard can be destroyed. 

# Skill Challenge - Destroying the Necroshard
The altar in the temple rectory can be reconsecrated, and once the altar is again a divine conduit for the power of Waukeen, the necroshard can be destroyed by placing it on the altar and performing a ritual, represented by this skill challenge. 

**Level:** 2 (40 xp)
**Complexity:** 2 (requires 6 successes before 3 failures)
**Primary Skills:** [[skills#Religion|Religion]]
**Secondary Skills:** [[skills#Diplomacy|Diplomacy]], [[skills#Crafting|Crafting]]

### Primary Skills
**Religion (DC 10, 1 success, no maximum):** You call upon the power of Waukeen to destroy the necroshard. You gain a +2 bonus to this check if you received divine aid from Waukeen during the Zombie-Proofing the Temple and Shoring Up the Defenses skill challenges. 

### Secondary Skills
**Diplomacy (DC 10, no successes):** Waukeen is the goddess of trade and civilization, and is known to be both diplomatic and reasonable. You’re no cleric, but your silver tongue might sway the goddess to aid you in your endeavor. You grant a +2 bonus to one ally’s next Religion check made as part of this skill challenge. 

**Crafting (DC 15, no success):** You use your knowledge of stonework to remove all traces of evil iconography from the altar. On a success, all Religion checks made as part of this skill challenge gain a +2 bonus. 

### Success
Waukeen lends her divine power to the characters, the altar is reconsecrated, and the necroshard is destroyed in a blast of white light. The characters gain an additional 50 XP for destroying the necroshard. In addition, Waukeen’s followers hear of the characters’ deed, and their favorable opinion of the heroes could take the form of a number of future benefits. 

### Failure 
If the characters fail the skill challenge, allow them try again with a –2 penalty to all checks. However, if they fail the skill challenge a second time, they fail to destroy the necroshard, and in the process, they offend Waukeen. Until they can divine some way to destroy the necroshard—perhaps by beseeching aid from a high priest of a good-aligned deity—they receive a –1 penalty to all Diplomacy checks.

# Keeping the Shard 
If the characters decide to keep the necroshard, they can harness its power by placing it in the hilt of a weapon. Encasing the shard in metal is the only safe way for it to be handled; however, even if the characters take this precaution, the necroshard can still be dangerous to its owner and his or her allies.
