After a short reprieve, the zombie horde makes a stronger push to overrun the characters. This encounter is handled much like the previous one and uses the Shoring up the Defenses skill challenge while the characters battle zombies. However, the second wave encounter includes a few significant changes:
* The initial group of breaching zombies includes a new type of zombie unique to the necromantic energies of the necroshard. The shard zombie is both intelligent and powerful, and would be an ideal candidate to insert a familiar face, as mentioned in the “Hey, I Know That Zombie” sidebar. In addition to the shard zombie, 2 corruption corpses, 2 hobgoblin zombies, and 6 zombie rotters comprise the initial group of zombies the character face in this encounter. Like the first encounter, divide the zombies into two groups, and then roll 1d8 twice to determine the two entry points the undead breach.
* Run the Shoring up the Defenses skill challenge again. However, this time, when the characters fail a primary skill check, three zombie rotters break through and join the combat. If the characters completely fail the skill challenge (earn three failures), an additional corruption corpse breaks through and joins the combat. Remember, even if the characters fail the skill challenge completely, they still manage to repair their defenses and hold off the zombie horde. They just have to fight a lot more zombies to accomplish the same goal.

# Development
If the characters can survive this last assault, they are witness to a glorious sight after the last zombie falls. 

When the characters defeat the last zombie in this encounter, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The zombie shudders and collapses as the energy animating its rotting body dissipates from your attack. You turn toward the main doors, expecting another wave of fiendish undead. Instead, the temple interior is suddenly filled with shafts of pale, morning sunshine, bursting through the cracks and holes in the doors and walls. You then realize the forest outside the temple walls has become still and quiet. 

Dawn has come, and the power of the necroshard fades in the light of the morning sun. The characters have survived the night. However, when they finally exit the temple, one more horror awaits. 

When the characters exit the temple, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The clearing around the temple is littered with hundreds of bodies, from tiny, shrunken goblin corpses to the behemoth carcass of what appears to be a dragon. Corpses are stacked up against each of the temple doors ten and twenty high, and the stench of rot and death fills the air in a nauseating miasma.
