Not long after the characters erect their defenses, the zombie horde, now at full strength, makes a serious push to gain entrance into the temple. When this encounter begins, 2 grave hounds, 4 zombie rotters, and 2 zombie soldiers have managed to break into the temple. The characters need to fight off the zombies that make it inside while repairing their breached defenses. 

When the attack begins, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The temple is filled with a cacophony of thick, horrid moaning and the staccato rhythm of hundreds of undead fists beating against the temple doors. Suddenly, a sharp cracking noise echoes through the temple, and you realize your defenses have been breached! 

For this encounter and the next one, there are eight numbered entry points into the temple, although only six are visible to the characters: the main door, the two sets of doors along the east and west walls, and the pit in the floor. The remaining two entrances are tunnels dug by the zombies that open up in the floor of the temple, creating a pit just like the one currently visible. If one of the tunnel entrances is rolled, replace the rubble square with a pit, which remains visible for the rest of the encounter. 

When the encounter begins, spilt the initial group of zombies into two groups of 1 grave hound, 2 zombie rotters, and 1 zombie soldier, and then roll a d8 twice (reroll duplicate rolls) to determine which two entry points the first wave of zombies breaches. 

# Skill Challenge - Shoring Up the Defenses

During the battle, the characters need to repair their defenses to prevent more zombies from breaking into the temple.

**Level:** 2 (40 xp)
**Complexity:** 1 (requires 4 successes before 3 failures)
**Primary Skills:**  [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]], [[skills#Crafting|Crafting]], [[skills#Religion|Religion]], [[skills#Thievery|THievery]]]
**Secondary Skills:** [[skills#Perception|Perception]]

### Primary Skills
**Athletics (DC 15, standard action, 1 success, no maximum):** The character realizes finesse is no trade for quick and effective physical labor. The character pounds nails, carries heavy objects, and uses brute strength shove invading zombies back through the doors.

**Crafting** (DC 15, standard action, 1 success, no maximum): The character’s knowledge of stone and construction lets him or her see how the temple might best be fortified using the meager supplies available.

**Religion (DC 15, standard action, 1 success, no maximum):** The character offers a prayer to Waukeen, asking her to lend her strength to the characters’ endeavor and slow the tide of undead seeking to further desecrate her temple.

**Thievery (DC 15, standard action, 1 success, no maximum):** The character has spent a lifetime getting into places he or she is not wanted. It’s not terribly difficult to turn that concept on its head and use those skills to craft sturdy barricades. 

### Secondary Skills
**Perception (DC 5, minor action, no successes):** The character’s keen eyes help more skilled companions find the best materials to aid in fortifying the temple. A successful check grants a +2 bonus to one ally’s next Crafting or Thievery check made as part of this skill challenge

### Success
The characters succeed in repairing their defenses, and only face the initial number of zombies.

### Failure 
Each time the characters fail a primary skill check, a group of two zombie brutes and a single zombie owlbear einters the combat (roll 1d8 to determine which entry point they breach). If the characters score three failures (a complete failure), an additional zombie brute enters the fray from one of the breached entry points (roll randomly). The characters cannot accrue failures by failing skill checks. Instead, a failure represents bad timing and sloppy execution by the characters. They still repair the defenses; they just have to fight off more zombies while doing it. See the “Man the Defenses” call out in the Zombie Siege encounter for more details. 

### Special 
The skill challenge simulates the characters fighting off zombies while fortifying the temple’s defenses. Note that these two events happen simultaneously. On any round that the characters do not attempt at least one primary skill check, it counts as a failure and more zombies breach the characters’ defenses.

> [!note]+ Call Out
> HEY, I KNOW THAT ZOMBIE!
> 
> Have villains from the past show up as a zombie. Zombified versions of The Hand of Torog from Den of the Slavetakers, the halflings from the Brothers Grey, or bullywugs from Stick in the Mud all work well. In addition to serving as a fun Easter egg for your players, the appearance of these villains clearly demonstrates the far-reaching power of the necroshard.

# Development 
If the characters fight off the zombies and complete the skill challenge, they buy themselves another few hours of reprieve. However, the zombie horde is not done with the characters yet, and another, stronger push is on the way.
