The sun has set and darkness has fallen over the temple. Now that the characters have dealt with the zombies in the temple and identified the necroshard, the real fun begins. Right after the characters identify the necroshard (see area 2), they hear a terrific commotion above them and outside the temple interior. At this point, they should race up the stairs to investigate. 

When the characters reach the temple interior, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Outside the temple, the forest is filled with a cacophony of agonized moaning and screaming that turns your blood to ice. Through the main entrance of the temple, you see a truly horrific sight. The forest, lit by shafts of pale moonlight, is alive with rotting corpses clawing their way free from shallow graves. You try to count their numbers, but soon realize there is little point. The undead horde appears to approach several hundred, if not several thousand, members. There is nowhere to run; stiff, shambling forms fill the landscape as far as you can see in every direction. The dubious safety of the temple is now your only hope of survival. 

# Skill Challenge - Zombie Proofing the Temple

The zombies and other undead animated by the necroshard are sluggish at first, and many of them must claw their way free from the earth. This gives the characters a few precious minutes to barricade the doors and set up their defenses. Use this skill challenge to represent fortifying the temple.

**Level:** 2 (40 xp)
**Complexity:** 3 (requires 8 successes before 3 failures)
**Primary Skills:**  [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]], [[skills#Crafting|Crafting]], [[skills#Religion|Religion]], [[skills#Thievery|Thievery]]]
**Secondary Skills:** [[skills#Perception|Perception]]

### Primary Skills
**Athletics (DC 15, standard action, 1 success, no max):** The character realizes finesse is no trade for quick and effective physical labor. The character pounds nails, carries heavy objects, and uses brute strength shove invading zombies back through the doors.

**Crafting (DC 15, standard action, 1 success, no maximum):** The character’s knowledge of stone and construction lets him or her see how the temple might best be fortified using the meager supplies available.

**Religion (DC 15, standard action, 1 success, no maximum):** The character offers a prayer to Waukeen, asking her to lend her strength to the characters’ endeavor and slow the tide of undead seeking to further desecrate her temple.

**Thievery (DC 15, standard action, 1 success, no maximum):** The character has spent a lifetime getting into places he or she is not wanted. It’s not terribly difficult to turn that concept on its head and use those skills to craft sturdy barricades. 

### Secondary Skills
**Perception (DC 5, minor action, no successes):** The character’s keen eyes help more skilled companions find the best materials to aid in fortifying the temple. A successful check grants a +2 bonus to one ally’s next Crafting or Thievery check made as part of this skill challenge

### Success
The characters succeed in fortifying the temple and buy themselves some time before the next wave of zombies.

### Failure 
Each time the characters fail a primary skill check, a group of four zombie brutes and two zombie shamblers break through the characters’ hastily erected defenses. This encounter uses only the six visible entry points in the temple (numbered 1 though 6): the main door, the two sets of doors along the east and west walls, and the pit in the floor. Roll `dice: 1d6` to determine which entry point the zombies break through. 

The characters can’t really fail here; otherwise, they would be overrun by zombies and massacred. Instead, a failure represents bad timing and sloppy execution. They still erect the defenses; they just have to fight off more zombies while doing so. See the “Man the Defenses” call out for more details on this skill challenge.

> **MAN THE DEFENSES!** 
> 
> The Zombie-Proofing the Temple and Shoring Up the Defenses skill challenges are only peripherally concerned with the manual labor of fortifying the temple or repairing barricades. They’re mostly concerned with getting the temple barricaded or getting the defenses repaired before the zombies overwhelm the heroes. A primary skill check failure does not mean the character didn’t use the proper materials or flawless construction techniques. Rather, it represents bad timing: A zombie manages to squirm through a hole in the wall before the character can nail a board over it; a zombie slams through a door before the character can throw his weight against it. In addition, failing the skill challenge doesn’t mean the zombies overwhelm the heroes; it means the characters were less efficient than they could have been, and they had to fight more zombies as a result.

### Special 
The skill challenge simulates the characters fighting off zombies while fortifying the temple’s defenses. Note that these two events happen simultaneously. On any round that the characters do not attempt at least one primary skill check, it counts as a failure and more zombies breach the characters’ defenses.

Tactics The zombie soldier remains close to a zombie rotter during combat, using protective strike to hamper the characters attacks against the zombie minions. The zombie rotters simply attack the closest character, flailing away with slam attacks.

> At some point, the players might think fighting their way through the zombie horde is a better option than remaining in the temple and enduring an undead siege. If this option comes up, let the players get a good look at what they’re facing. Read the following: 
> 
> You look out upon a nightmarish scene. Hundreds of animated corpses crowd around the temple, three and four rows deep. Humans, dwarves, elves, and every conceivable race, both civilized and savage, are represented among the shambling horde. Worse yet, the corpses of dinosaurs, dire animals, and even more fantastic beasts add their mass and strength to the zombie assault. 
> 
> Despite the zombies’ numbers, there are still gaps in their ranks; gaps the fleet and nimble among you might use to escape the multitudes of undead. However, as if the gods were reading your thoughts, a stag suddenly bursts from cover and runs a bounding course through the advancing zombies. Hope soars within you as the stag easily dodges the clumsy blows of the first few undead it encounters… before the great, animated corpse of a tyrannosaurus rex surges from the mass of undead bodies surrounding the temple and snaps the stag up in its colossal jaws. The stag utters a single bleat of pain and surprise before the zombie T-rex’s jaws slam down, stifling the stag’s cries in a gout of blood. A wriggling pile of smaller zombies quickly forms around the undead dinosaur, eager for the gobbets of flesh falling from its mouth. 
> 
> The stag provides only a momentary distraction for the zombie horde. In seconds, there is little left of the poor beast beyond a crimson smear on the ground. But there is fresher fare still to be had, and the masses of undead press in, clawing at your hastily erected defenses and creating an impassable wall of rotting flesh.
