The trapdoor in the northern end of the temple interior leads to a small rectory that once served as the personal quarters of the temple’s high priests. It was here Garvus Harbane performed the ritual that claimed his life and the lives of his followers so many years ago. His corpse, withered and all but mummified, is still here, the necroshard hanging from its shriveled neck. 

Although the corpses in the forest will animate tonight for the first time, the corpse of Garvus Harbane, due to its close proximity to the necroshard, has been animating each night for the past few weeks as a deathlock wight. Garvus, however, is not alone in the rectory. Doran Underhelm and his mercenary group Doran’s Daggers decided to spend the night in the temple rectory after a fruitless exploration of the temple. When night fell, the necroshard’s power was unleashed and Garvus’ animated corpse slew them all. 

When the characters enter the temple rectory, read: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The trapdoor opens easily with a gentle tug, unleashing a blast of violent purple light followed by the charnel stench of death. A short spiral staircase leads down 10 feet into a small rectory. The room below contains two sets of tables and chairs, a moth-eaten bearskin rug, two unlit braziers similar to those in the temple above, and two small beds with footlockers in an alcove. A small altar sits against the northern wall, and a pair of double doors stands in the center of the west wall. 
> 
> Three rotting corpses lay in a heap near the two beds in the southern end of the room. Each is dressed in leather armor, now tattered and crusted with dried gore, and they all appear to have been half-devoured. A fourth corpse sits before the altar, legs curled beneath it, head bowed as if in prayer. This corpse is little more than a mummified husk, and its moth-eaten clerical robes bear the dire skull symbol of Orcus. Around its neck hangs a large, black gem on a crude leather thong. The gem glows brightly with a dire purple light that fills you with queasy dread. 

As the characters begin to examine the room, the sun sets and the power of the necroshard is unleashed. The first clue that the characters are in real trouble is the animation of the corpses of Garvus and Doran’s Daggers. 

When the corpses animate, read: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The rectory is suddenly filled with a low, guttural moaning. To your horror, the four corpses, no longer simply inert flesh, climb unsteadily to their feet. The gem around the neck of mummified cleric pulses brightly as the four undead horrors lurch to the attack. 

# Tactics 
The zombie adventurers attack the nearest character with zombie grab. At first, Garvus stays clear of melee and attacks the characters with grave bolt or horrific visage when it can avoid catching the zombie adventurers in the blast. When two of the zombie adventurers have fallen, Garvus uses reanimate and then enters melee. The undead in the rectory fight to their destruction.

The characters should recognize the black gem around Garvus’ neck as a meteor fragment. They can learn more about its function and purpose with a DC 15 [[skills#Arcana|Arcana]] or [[skills#Religion|Religion]] check. For each successful skill check the characters make, give them one of the following pieces of information.   On a critical success, the characters earn two of the pieces of information.
* This shard radiates staggering amounts of necromantic energy, easily enough to animate the dead within the rectory. 
* The shard’s power is likely strengthened by the lingering energy in the temple of Orcus. 
* The shard’s power, like many evil items and creatures, is stronger at night. 
* Undead may be drawn to the energy produced by the shard. 

Now that the characters have the necroshard and likely understand its dire potential, what they do with it based on this knowledge could have serious consequences during the zombie siege. Below is a list of possible actions the characters might take and the consequences of those actions. 
* **Bring it Along:** If the characters take the necroshard from the rectory, the character carrying the necroshard on his or her person becomes the center of attention during the ensuing zombie siege. Whenever the character carrying the necroshard fails a skill check in the Zombie-Proofing the Temple and Shoring Up the Defenses skill challenges, add an additional zombie to the number of zombies breaching the defenses. 
* **Destroy It:** If the characters decide to destroy the necroshard, they can do so, as detailed in the Destroying the Necroshard section at the end of the adventure. However, if the necroshard is destroyed at night, at the height of its power, it unleashes one final, mammoth burst of necromantic energy. This massive infusion of power keeps the zombies animated until sunrise and sends the undead horde into a berserk frenzy. Whenever the characters fail a skill check during the Zombie-Proofing the Temple and Shoring Up the Defenses skill challenges add an additional zombie to the number of zombies breaching the defenses. 
* **Leave it Alone:** If the characters simply leave the necroshard in the rectory, events proceed as normal in the adventure. In this scenario, there are no significant changes to the adventure as written. 
* **Let Them Have It:** At some point, knowing the zombies are drawn to the necroshard, the characters might decide that letting the zombies have the damnable thing is the best course of action. Tossing the necroshard out an open door, however, does little to dissuade the hungry undead from their secondary goal: eating the characters. In addition, the zombie that ends up with the necroshard is instantly transformed into a shard zombie (see Zombie Siege: Second Wave) and is added to the number of zombies breaching the characters defenses the next time they fail a primary skill check in the Zombie-Proofing the Temple or Shoring Up the Defenses skill challenges.

# Features of the Area
**Illumination:** The necroshard provides dim illumination. 

**Ceiling:** The ceiling in this area is 10 feet high. 

**Altar:** The small altar here is dedicated to Orcus. However, a DC 15 [[skills#Perception|Perception]] check reveals that it was once dedicated to Waukeen and later desecrated. 

**Beds:** The beds are difficult terrain that provides cover. 

**Braziers:** If lit, the two braziers provide bright illumination out to 4 squares. 

**Doors:** The doors along the east wall are jammed, swelled and rusted with age. Opening these doors requires a DC 15 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check. Beyond the doors is an impassable, rubble choked passage. 

**Footlockers:** The footlockers are locked, but can be opened with a DC 10 [[skills#Thievery|Thievery]] check. They contain rotting clerical vestments and objects used in the worship of Orcus. 

**Tables and Chairs:** The tables and chairs are difficult terrain.

# Treasure 
If the characters search the adventurers’ corpses, they can identify Doran Underhelm by a tattoo of two crossed axes on his left forearm. As Farian promised, Doran has the rogue’s 100 gp payment and a pair of small agate (worth 5 sp each) in a large pouch on his belt.
