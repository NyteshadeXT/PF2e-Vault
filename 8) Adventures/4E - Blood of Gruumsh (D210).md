#  Background
Somewhere in the deep forest lies a derelict elven religious colony. Vines and overgrowth now obscure its elegant beauty, and brush chokes its soaring halls. This colony thrived quietly for generations before a sudden, brutal raid destroyed it. No survivors escaped to tell the tale, and those outsiders who did know of its existence blotted all traces of it from the records— or so they believed. 

Now, almost two hundred years later, a young elf cleric at a nearby temple of Corellon has stumbled across scant mentions in church records of a heretical sect in the forest. “What was its heresy?” he wondered. “What became of it?” 

So he asked the temple’s elder clerics, but they were unusually tight-lipped on the subject. All they would tell him was that the sect consisted of debased elves who worshiped both Gruumsh and Corellon, and that orcs destroyed it because it’s in their nature to destroy. 

Though the records the cleric discovered are frustratingly sparse, they contain enough clues to contradict that claim. The cleric, Tathar of Turilon, wants answers. The temple patriarch warned him to leave the question of the sect alone and forbade him to investigate further, but if Tathar hires adventurers to explore the ruins, then he won’t be the one doing the investigating. 

## A Tale of Heresy 
The inhabitants of the community called it simply “the Colony.” They paid due homage to Corellon, Sehanine, and the other members of the elven pantheon, but they also added a saint unique to their own worship: Phayrd, Banished Daughter, the Blood of Gruumsh. \

According to the sect’s mythology, Phayrd was the daughter of an elf mother and the god Gruumsh One-Eye, He Who Never Sleeps, brother and nemesis of Corellon, and the sworn foe of all elves. Elf scholars and clerics doubt that such a half-breed creature could even exist—and if it did, it would be an abomination of the most horrid sort. 

This heretical sect maintained that Phayrd not only could exist, but did. A legend now lost to time maintained that her mother and her orc stepfather, both cast out of their respective societies, raised Phayrd together deep in the woods. Phayrd’s sect believed that the child, with her mixed, semidivine blood, might someday heal the rift between elves and orcs. Instead, she died a martyr’s death before fulfilling her life’s purpose. 

Phayrd’s sect sought to further her work by bringing like-minded elves and orcs together in peaceful, worshipful communities. Such societies were understandably rare and justifiably reclusive. 

The members of the Colony settled in a dense forest, where they hoped that their community would remain undiscovered. Elves and orcs lived there communally for generations, until the followers of Corellon raised a new temple at the edge of the forest—the temple where Tathar now resides. In those unsettled days, the temple’s members were more militant than they are now, and many were followers of Kord as well as Corellon. It wasn’t long before rangers hunting in the forest discovered the Colony and reported its existence to the clerics. A war party from the temple fell on the Colony and, in Corellon’s name, slaughtered every living creature there. The temple elders erased all mention of the Colony’s discovery, heresy, and destruction from the records—or so the clerics believed, until Tathar stumbled across one. 

The temple’s two eldest leaders know the truth, because they accompanied the war party as young initiates. They believe the attack was justified, but they also understand that its brutality would reflect badly on the more moderate temple in today’s world. Blaming the slaughter on orcs should satisfy Tathar and deflect any guilt from the temple. 

## Is the Tale True? 
The answer to this question is up to you. The heretical cult certainly existed and can still have adherents in your campaign if you want them. Whether Phayrd was the half-elf daughter of Gruumsh and a true demigod or just a myth is your call. Residents of the Colony believed in her, and that fact is enough for this adventure.
