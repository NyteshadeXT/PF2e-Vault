#  Background
Somewhere in the deep forest lies a derelict elven religious colony. Vines and overgrowth now obscure its elegant beauty, and brush chokes its soaring halls. This colony thrived quietly for generations before a sudden, brutal raid destroyed it. No survivors escaped to tell the tale, and those outsiders who did know of its existence blotted all traces of it from the records— or so they believed. 

Now, almost two hundred years later, a young elf cleric at a nearby temple of Corellon has stumbled across scant mentions in church records of a heretical sect in the forest. “What was its heresy?” he wondered. “What became of it?” 

So he asked the temple’s elder clerics, but they were unusually tight-lipped on the subject. All they would tell him was that the sect consisted of debased elves who worshiped both Gruumsh and Corellon, and that orcs destroyed it because it’s in their nature to destroy. 

Though the records the cleric discovered are frustratingly sparse, they contain enough clues to contradict that claim. The cleric, Tathar of Turilon, wants answers. The temple patriarch warned him to leave the question of the sect alone and forbade him to investigate further, but if Tathar hires adventurers to explore the ruins, then he won’t be the one doing the investigating. 

## A Tale of Heresy 
The inhabitants of the community called it simply “the Colony.” They paid due homage to Corellon, Sehanine, and the other members of the elven pantheon, but they also added a saint unique to their own worship: Phayrd, Banished Daughter, the Blood of Gruumsh. \

According to the sect’s mythology, Phayrd was the daughter of an elf mother and the god Gruumsh One-Eye, He Who Never Sleeps, brother and nemesis of Corellon, and the sworn foe of all elves. Elf scholars and clerics doubt that such a half-breed creature could even exist—and if it did, it would be an abomination of the most horrid sort. 

This heretical sect maintained that Phayrd not only could exist, but did. A legend now lost to time maintained that her mother and her orc stepfather, both cast out of their respective societies, raised Phayrd together deep in the woods. Phayrd’s sect believed that the child, with her mixed, semidivine blood, might someday heal the rift between elves and orcs. Instead, she died a martyr’s death before fulfilling her life’s purpose. 

Phayrd’s sect sought to further her work by bringing like-minded elves and orcs together in peaceful, worshipful communities. Such societies were understandably rare and justifiably reclusive. 

The members of the Colony settled in a dense forest, where they hoped that their community would remain undiscovered. Elves and orcs lived there communally for generations, until the followers of Corellon raised a new temple at the edge of the forest—the temple where Tathar now resides. In those unsettled days, the temple’s members were more militant than they are now, and many were followers of Kord as well as Corellon. It wasn’t long before rangers hunting in the forest discovered the Colony and reported its existence to the clerics. A war party from the temple fell on the Colony and, in Corellon’s name, slaughtered every living creature there. The temple elders erased all mention of the Colony’s discovery, heresy, and destruction from the records—or so the clerics believed, until Tathar stumbled across one. 

The temple’s two eldest leaders know the truth, because they accompanied the war party as young initiates. They believe the attack was justified, but they also understand that its brutality would reflect badly on the more moderate temple in today’s world. Blaming the slaughter on orcs should satisfy Tathar and deflect any guilt from the temple. 

## Is the Tale True? 
The answer to this question is up to you. The heretical cult certainly existed and can still have adherents in your campaign if you want them. Whether Phayrd was the half-elf daughter of Gruumsh and a true demigod or just a myth is your call. Residents of the Colony believed in her, and that fact is enough for this adventure.

# Running the Adventure
10.  A visiting elf named Thathar is looking for some lost elven colony. He's apparently willing to pay for someone to find it for him. (Blood of Gruumsh)

Synopsis
Tathar of Turilon approaches the characters surreptitiously
and engages them to undertake a mission for
him (or see “Hooks,” below). He provides directions
that can lead the heroes to the site of the Colony,
where he wants them to learn everything they can
about its past and the fate of its inhabitants.
The trip to the Colony is uneventful unless you
choose to introduce one or two forest encounters.
Once at the site of the Colony, the characters can
explore, uncover clues, and deal with its current
residents: a wereboar, a dire boar, an owlbear, giant
spiders, a dryad, and several wraiths.
The characters, however, are not the only ones
curious about the Colony. Venak, an orc cleric of
Gruumsh, has experienced a few visions relating to
the fabled, heretical Blood of Gruumsh, and the subsequent
downfall of the Phayrd cult by murder and
massacre. The concept of mixing orc and elf blood is
as repugnant to orcs as it is to elves, but like Tathar,
Venak has become curious enough to seek out the
truth. He has assembled a small war band to find the
Colony and verify whether his vision was true. If so,
it could provide the spark to unite feuding orc tribes
against the elves.
Venak’s force arrives after the characters do. This
war band is the chief obstacle the characters must
overcome to complete their mission.
Hooks
The most direct hook is for Tathar of Turilon to
approach the characters covertly with an offer of
employment. If the characters have encountered
or aided another elf cleric in the past, use that nonplayer
character instead. Tathar explains as much as
he must to gain the characters’ confidence, but he is
growing paranoid about the temple elders and doesn’t
want to admit too much. If Tathar’s suspicions are
correct, then this is serious heresy that he’s investigating,
and he wants to know the truth about it.
The main surprises for Tathar in the Colony’s
history are that the residents were almost equally
divided between elves and orcs, and that it was warriors
from his temple who carried out the massacre,
not roving orcs. If the characters bring back evidence
of that latter fact, he is horrified to learn of it.
The characters might also have their own reasons
to investigate this legend. If one of them is an elf
cleric, let that character stumble onto the legend in
a temple library, instead of using Tathar. A character
who has elf or orc blood might recall childish bogeyman
stories about Gruumsh’s monstrous offspring.
Such tales always contain more fiction than fact, but
they could spark curiosity in the characters.
Finally, the heroes could simply stumble onto the
Colony’s doorstep while traveling (or while lost) in
the forest. They could pick up the owlbear’s trail and
track it to its lair. Or they could be seeking a sheltered
spot where they can hole up against prowling orcs.
(Venak’s war band, with reinforcements, is combing
the forest for the Colony—but for all the characters
know, the orcs could be hunting them.)
Quests
The characters can complete two quests during the
adventure.
MAJOR QUEST: BRING ANSWERS TO
TATHAR OF TURILON
5th-Level Major Quest (200 XP/character)
Coming back to Tathar with precise information
about Phayrd and the Blood of Gruumsh legend,
along with proof that warriors from Tathar’s temple
were responsible for the destruction of the colony and
the murder of everyone there, earns each character
200 XP.
MAJOR QUEST:
DESTROY VENAK’S WAR BAND
5th-Level Major Quest (200 XP/character)
Destroying Venak’s war band (see “Showdown”)
is worth 200 XP for each character in the group. If
Venak survives without learning anything about the
Blood of Gruumsh, characters earn 100 XP apiece
instead.
The Colony
At its height, the Colony was more extensive than
the map indicates. The overgrowth of the residences
is so extensive now that they’re almost impossible to
locate. Only the sturdier, communal areas remain.
The forest surrounding the Colony is uncommonly
thick. If you choose to map it, every square in a radius
of one-half mile should be difficult terrain. Exceptions
exist where the owlbear has plowed out hunting
trails of its own.
The Colony’s “structures” are hollowed out of
this dense foliage. Their floors are made of packed
earth (at ground level) or woven of living branches
and vines (at upper levels). The ceilings are 15 feet
high unless noted otherwise, and upper floors are 5
feet thick. Characters equipped with axes could cut
a Medium-size hole down through a floor in 1 hour.
Using a tool other than an axe doubles the time, as
does cutting up instead of down.
The chambers don’t have walls in the normal
sense. Instead, interwoven branches and vines
enclose each of the inner spaces. After growing
together for 200 years, such barriers have a density
similar to the thickest of hedges.
These walls are blocking terrain, but a character
who begins a move action adjacent to a wall square
can force his or her way into that square with a DC
21 Athletics check. If the check fails, the character
doesn’t move and that move action ends. If the check
succeeds, the character moves 1 square into the wall
and that move action ends. A character in a wall
square is squeezing and can move from a wall square
into clear or difficult terrain normally.
The middle level is 20 feet above the ground, and
the upper level is 40 feet above the ground. Characters
who step out of an upper chamber’s wall into
the difficult terrain outside must fly, teleport from
branch to branch, or climb. Climbing is necessary for
both horizontal and vertical movement while above
the ground. Most characters’ speeds are halved for
the difficult terrain and halved again for climbing. At
ground level, characters need only deal with difficult
terrain.
Forest squares are heavily obscured.
Because the Colony was wiped out so rapidly, it
still contains many of the resident elves’ and orcs’
furnishings and belongings. Characters who spend
10 minutes searching an area might find something
useful, or at least something interesting. No skill
check is necessary to find such items because they
aren’t purposefully concealed; they’re just overgrown
or covered by a blanket of fallen leaves and vegetation.
Select from the following list or make up your
own items. Any of these items can be ruined, damaged
but repairable, or in usable condition.

Bones, elf
Bones, orc

1. Grand Hall
Exploration Encounter
The grand entrance hall was designed to make an
impression on visitors. After a century of neglect, it
still can.
Light: Originally, skillfully positioned skylights
pierced the canopy, but overgrowth has now clogged
most of them. The light that gets through now provides
only dim illumination.
A few shafts of green-filtered sunlight penetrate the forest
canopy to reveal a grand hall. Its arched ceiling of beautifully
twined branches soars a full 50 feet above the ground.
The trunks of the trees supporting this sylvan ceiling bear
intricate, symmetrical designs that seem to be part of the
wood. In its heyday, this hall would have been a marvel
of living architecture. Now, vines hang thickly overhead,
thorny brush encroaches through the lovingly sculpted
green walls, and weeds grow waist-high across the floor.
Perception DC 14: The tall weeds growing throughout
the chamber hide dozens of elf and orc skeletons.
Nature DC 14 (trained only): A large boar has
passed through this area several times in the last week.
The Grand Hall never had any furnishings; it was
simply an open space for receptions and gatherings.
Aside from the encroaching forest, it hasn’t changed
from its original state. The patterns in the tree trunks
were not carved—they are the result of skillfully grafting
different types of wood and vines onto the trunks.
2. Ready Room
Exploration Encounter
The Colony’s small contingent of guards stood watch
in this room. Though the sentries fought bravely to
the end, they were bottled up by the initial onslaught
of the elves and couldn’t avert the inevitable.
Light: Dim light filters through the canopy.
The trees lining this area are so closely spaced that they
form an almost solid wall. The bones of humanoids litter
the floor and pile up beside the entryway, which seems to
be the only way into the chamber. Scavengers have dragged
the bones around the room to such an extent that it’s impossible
to tell how many fell here. The remains of an upended
table and several benches are easy to spot in the greenery.
Perception DC 14: A fierce fight must have taken
place here to account for the large number of bolts and
arrowheads embedded in the trees. Sturdy pegs in the trees
could have supported considerable weight.
The Colony built this room to be easily defensible,
so it’s an ideal place for the characters to take a long
rest or to use as a sanctuary if they’re hard pressed by
enemies. A single character can block the entryway
effectively.
The pegs in the trees were for hanging up the
guards’ shields, weapons, and other equipment.
3. Owlbear Den
Exploration Encounter
An owlbear uses this room for its den.
Light: Dim light filters through the canopy.
A powerful animal smell fills this enclosed space. The
ground is hard-packed and bare except where leaves and
branches have been scraped into a rough nest. Animal
bones litter the floor, and the surrounding trees bear the
scars of claws as high as 10 feet above the ground.
Across the chamber, stair steps spiral around the trunk
of a large tree, but all of them below 10 feet from the
ground are smashed. The remaining steps ascend through a
hole in the greenery that forms the ceiling.
Nature DC 10: A large carnivore makes its lair here.
The bones on the floor are from deer, foxes, and other large
forest animals. A creature with powerful jaws has cracked
and gnawed them.
Perception DC 14: Dozens of birds squawk somewhere
above, but not in this chamber.
The owlbear isn’t home when characters enter its den.
When it returns, it immediately picks up the scent
of intruders. Thereafter, characters might hear it or
catch an occasional glimpse of a large shape through
the foliage, but they shouldn’t encounter the owlbear
directly until their battle against the wereboar (area 7).
Buried in the nest are the remains of a dwarf
ranger who stumbled across the owlbear’s path a few
months ago. The items in the nest include his skull, a
magic throwing hammer, a large shield, a gashed and
bloodstained suit of hide armor that has been gnawed
beyond repair, and a few bits of treasure.
Climbing the 10 feet to the lowest intact steps
requires a DC 15 Athletics check.
Treasure: Characters who search the remains of
the dead dwarf find 16 gp and a throwing hammer +1.
4. Salon
Exploration Encounter
The elves used this chamber as an informal social
space. Here they could gather and discuss whatever
was on their minds, from philosophy to gossip.
Light: Dim light filters through the canopy.
Mounds of waist-high greenery obscure angular shapes
scattered through this space. In a few places, gaps in the
overgrowth reveal that the shapes beneath are tables, chairs,
and benches built of simple, heavy timber. The trunks of the
surrounding trees bear graceful, frivolous designs.
Clearing away some of the brush reveals that the
furniture has survived in remarkably good condition,
thanks to its sturdy, unpretentious construction.
Anyone who pokes through the encroaching underbrush
finds the remains of five elves and three orcs
(no check needed).
Treasure: Three jeweled silver goblets and a silver
tray worth a total of 610 gp lie beneath an overturned
table.
5. Pool
Exploration Encounter
The shallow pool in this room is actually a powerful
oracular device. If the characters figure out its function,
the pool can answer important questions for
them.
Light: Dim light filters through the canopy.
A pool of water occupies the center of this circular space in
the modified forest. Lilies crowd its edges and vines grow
out across its surface, but the water looks clear and fresh.
Characters who inspect the chamber might learn the
following information by making the appropriate skill
checks.
Perception DC 14: Animals come to this pool to
drink. Most of the tracks are those of deer and small
creatures, but an immense bear and at least one wild
boar also visit regularly.
Perception DC 21: A shiny object is glinting from
beneath a mound of greenery.
Nature DC 14 (trained only): If the character
has tracked an owlbear or a dire boar before, he or
she recognizes the large tracks for what they are.
Arcana DC 21 (to detect magic): The pool is
magical. An additional source of magic (the bowl) is
hidden beneath a low mound of greenery.
Any character who dips the bowl into the pool and
fills it with water can make a DC 16 Arcana check. If
the check succeeds, the character understands that
he or she can ask the pool one question by framing it
mentally, then sweeping a hand gently across the surface
of the water in the bowl. The answer appears as
an image in the water. The question must be answerable
in no more than three words; otherwise, the pool
does not respond at all. The pool answers only one
question a day.
6. Lower Garden
Exploration Encounter
This chamber was once a beautiful garden. Although
no one has tended it for decades, traces of its former
beauty are still evident.
Light: Bright light shines through gaps in the
canopy.
Traps: The wereboar Angrad Nénharma has protected
the main path through the chamber with a
spear trap and the left-hand path with a concealed
pit trap. The spear trap consists of sharpened stakes
lashed to springy tree limbs positioned to stab any
creature on the path. The pit is just 5 feet deep, but
poisoned stakes line the bottom. Nénharma uses only
the right-hand path.
Shafts of light stream down through cunningly placed gaps
in the canopy far above. A profusion of multicolored plants
fills the chamber. From the entrance, overgrown but still
visible pathways branch and snake into the greenery.
Nature DC 14: The surrounding woods have
encroached into this chamber as much as they have in all
the others, but growing alongside the brush and scrub trees
are exotic, aromatic flowers and stunted ornamental trees
not native to this forest.
Perception DC 16: One of the pathways into the
chamber is broader than the others and is probably the
main path. Only the narrow trail to the right shows signs of
recent traffic, and whoever used it attempted to conceal the
evidence.
The traps are unlikely to cause serious injury to characters.
Their dual purposes are to warn Nénharma of
intruders and to demonstrate to the players that this
place is not all flowers and reflecting pools.
7. Topiary (Wereboar’s Lair)
Combat Encounter Level 5 (XP 1,200)
This is the home of the wereboar Angrad Nénharma
and his dire boar companion.
Light: Dim light filters through the canopy.
Monsters: Angrad Nénharma (wereboar), dire
boar, owlbear.
Several large, shaggy humanoid and animal forms stand
perfectly still about this gloomy chamber, leafy cloaks
wrapped tightly around them.
Perception DC 10: The shapes are actually bushes
trimmed into likenesses of animals, monsters, and people.
Obviously untended for decades, all these bushes look as if
they are wearing cloaks of leaves and branches.
Allow the characters one round of actions, then continue
with the following.
From ahead comes the sound of a creature grunting and
moving around, but the source is not yet visible.
Nature DC 10: The grunting sounds are like those of
a large boar—possibly even a dire boar.
Perception DC 14 (only if someone noticed the
used trail in area 6): The faint trail from the garden
leads into this chamber. No attempt has been made to conceal
the tracks here.
A spiral staircase carved into the trunk of a tree at the
rear of the chamber leads up to the middle level.
Treasure: With a DC 14 Perception check, a character
who searches this chamber finds a treasure
cache in a hollow space beneath a flat rock. Wrapped
in silk are two gems worth 100 gp each and three
statuettes of mythic figures from elven lore worth 250
gp each. One of the statuettes portrays Phayrd; a DC
22 Religion check reveals this fact.
Tactics: If a fight begins here, Nénharma shouts a
warning to the characters about the owlbear behind
them. While the characters focus on the owlbear,
Nénharma shifts form and attacks. With the characters
caught between the wereboar and the dire boar
on one side and the owlbear on the other, at least one
of the three attackers should be able to focus on the
more vulnerable characters who usually avoid melee.
When the fight turns against him, Nénharma shifts
into boar form and makes a dash for safety in the
woods, leaving the owlbear and his animal companion
to cover his retreat.
Angrad Nénharma
Nénharma is an elf and a wereboar. He lives alone
here because he despises civilized company. The dire
boar is his only companion; the two have developed a
tight animal–master bond. Nénharma knows nothing
about the Colony or the Blood of Gruumsh, and he
has no interest in those topics.
When the characters arrive, Nénharma is in elf
form, reading or clumsily mending clothes in his
lair. He presents himself as a simple hermit, explaining
that he stumbled into these ruins while seeking
solitude and decided to make his home here. He
befriended the dire boar with gifts of food. The
creature provides him with just the right amount of
company—
that is, not much.
Nénharma wears clothing rougher than the typical
elf ’s garb, and he has a vaguely brutish air about
him, unlike any other elf the characters have known.
His speech is brusque and sometimes crude, and
his manners are poor. If the characters ask the same
questions repeatedly or are rude, Nénharma shows
flashes of ill temper. He controls himself, but not
without a brief mental struggle. None of these characteristics
are shocking, given Nénharma’s antisocial
lifestyle, but they are odd in an elf.
Nénharma has done an excellent job of taming the
dire boar. It responds to his commands almost like a
trained dog.
Despite his brutish nature, Nénharma makes
every effort to appear friendly and helpful. He offers
to share his meager food and shelter, but he doesn’t
convey any truly useful information about himself
or the layout of the ruins. He does, however, make
a point of warning the characters that an owlbear
lives in the area. He explains that the creature leaves
him alone, but it is especially large and dangerous, as
should be obvious from its claw marks on the trees.
Once he has found out why the intruders are here
and taken their measure in conversation, Nénharma
decides whether to attack. If the characters believe
his story and seem inclined to leave him alone, then
he waits until an opportune time (of your choosing)
to ambush them. If the heroes seem eager to fight,
then they hear a large creature crashing toward them
through the garden. Nénharma shouts a warning that
the owlbear must have tracked them here. When the
characters turn to deal with the rampaging owlbear,
Nénharma shifts form and attacks from behind.
8. Library
Exploration Encounter
The elves of the Colony stored their books in this
chamber. A disastrous fire burned most of these volumes
to ash during the Colony’s destruction.
Arcana DC 14: The residue of powerful protective
magic lingers here, but its source is general and
nondirectional.
Light: Dim light filters through the canopy.
Broken benches, smashed shelves, and overturned tables
of heavy oak lie in shattered heaps across a floor made of
tightly twined branches and vines. A handful of waterdamaged
and bug-eaten books lie atop the debris.
Nature DC 14: Less plant life has encroached into this
chamber than elsewhere, for no obvious reason.
The colony mages magically shielded this chamber
against the ravages of nature during the years of its
use. The wards have weakened in the decades since,
letting in insects and water, but they’re still potent
enough to prevent encroachment by large plants.
Examining the Books: From the remaining
books, characters can glean scraps of information
about the Colony and the Blood of Gruumsh. A
character who studies the books can make a DC 14
History check for every 30 minutes spent on the task.
Each character can make up to three checks. Successful
checks reveal the following information.
First Success: The residents of the Colony were
not all elves. Almost half of them were orcs who
dedicated themselves to living a more elven lifestyle,
in emulation of Phayrd.
Second Success: A militant elven sect dedicated
to Corellon and Kord raised a temple at the edge of
the forest. Rangers who brought game to the temple
expanded their sway, hunting nearer and nearer to
the Colony as time went on.
Third Success: Hunters from the temple discovered
the Colony’s location. Residents of the Colony feared
that trouble would come, but they refused to abandon
their homes.
9. Upper Garden
Combat Encounter Level 7 (1,600 XP)
This garden is similar to the Lower Garden (area 6)
in most respects. The chief difference is the host of
deadly spiders in this area.
Perception DC 14: Dark shapes lurk throughout
the webs. Every 2 points by which the roll exceeds 14
increases the number of creatures seen by one, to a
maximum of five.
Light: Bright light shines through the canopy.
Monsters: 2 deathjump spiders, 3 spider swarms.
The chamber ahead is a riot of colorful plants, but the mass
of webs spun between every available tree trunk and limb
mutes their vibrancy.
Nature DC 14: The surrounding woods have
encroached into this chamber as much as all the others, but
growing alongside the brush and scrub trees are exotic, aromatic
flowers and ornamental vines not native to this forest.
This encounter happens in two waves. After killing
the spiders in this chamber, the characters are
likely to take a short rest. While they do—before they
gain the benefits of resting—the spiders from area
13 attack. If characters explore the Armory before
the Upper Garden, then the situation is reversed; the
spiders here attack during the characters’ short rest in
area 13.
Webs: Squares containing spider webs are difficult
terrain.
Concealed Doorway: A heavy layer of webbing
conceals the doorway connecting this chamber to
area 13. The observer cannot see the doorway if more
than 1 square of webbing lies in between. The spiders,
of course, know exactly where the doorway is.
Tactics: The spiders wait until characters move
into the chamber before attacking, if possible. Otherwise,
they fight back as soon as the characters attack
them. If the heroes haven’t already killed them, a
second wave of spiders arrives from area 13 while the
characters try to rest. Spiders pursue characters into
chambers 8, 10, 12, and 14, but no farther.
10. Chapel
Exploration Encounter
This chamber served as a ceremonial chapel for the
Colony. The members used it chiefly for weddings
and funerals.
Light: Bright light shines through a large gap in
the canopy.
This chamber is brighter, but far less verdant, than the
others. Evidence of a long-ago fire provides a reason for
both anomalies. The surrounding trees bear old scorch
marks, and the fire-scarred stumps of thick branches ring a
gaping hole in the canopy overhead.
Religion DC 14: The layout of this chamber suggests
a religious use, but no traces remain to suggest who or what
was worshiped here.
The attackers destroyed this chamber and its contents
utterly. They reduced the carved wooden icons
of Phayrd to kindling, heaped it in the center of the
chamber, and used it to start a fire and that would
burn out all traces of heresy.
Treasure: If the characters explore the room, a
DC 21 Perception check uncovers a lump of electrum
with assorted gems embedded in it beneath the vines
and brush in the center of the room. This piece is all
that remains of the gold and silver chapel ornaments
that the raiders tossed into the fire. The disk of metal
is roughly 2 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, making
it unwieldy unless the characters beat or bend it into
a more convenient shape. The metal is worth 650 gp
and the gems 400 gp, but the characters can’t get that
much for it. A goldsmith or jeweler offers 700 gp for
the lump, and any other merchant offers only 1d6 ×
100 gp.
11. Crypt
Exploration Encounter
The residents of the Colony interred their dead here.
Ritual required that they first leave bodies exposed
on wooden platforms. When the elements and scavengers
had removed all the flesh and entrails, Colony
members moved the remains here, building an intricate
stack of bones at the center of the chamber. The
attackers tossed many more bodies here after the
assault. Those corpses lie in tangled heaps where they
landed.
Light: Dim light filters through the canopy.
Bones fill every corner of this gloomy chamber. A low pyramid
of individual bones and skulls in the center of the room
appears to have been built with care, but other skeletons lie
haphazardly in tangled heaps.
Characters who inspect the room might learn the following
information by making the appropriate skill
checks:
Heal DC 14: The bones in the chamber—both
those in the pyramid and those scattered on the
floor—are a mix of elf and orc remains in almost
equal proportions.
Perception DC 14: The bones in the pyramid
are pristine, cleaned of all tissue, and unconnected to
each other. Those on the floor are complete skeletons,
except where scavengers have pulled them apart. Most
of the skeletons on the floor show signs of heavy blows
or cuts, or have metal arrowheads embedded in them.
Perception DC 21 (DC 10 for an elf, a half-elf,
or an eladrin): The arrowheads in the corpses are all
of elven manufacture.
The pyramid of bones is approximately 4 feet across
at the base and 5 feet high. Players might expect to
run into undead here. Nothing in the chamber is dangerous,
but don’t discourage the players’ suspicions.
12. Aviary
Exploration Encounter
The Colony’s residents built bird roosts here and
lured all manner of wild fowl to nest in them. Years
later, the birds continue to reside here. Their cackling
and singing can be heard clearly from areas 3, 13,
and 14, and distantly from everywhere else.
Lurking among the birds is a pseudodragon that
reports the presence of intruders to the dryad in
area 15.
Light: Bright light shines through large gaps in the
canopy.
Loud squawking, singing, and chirping is audible well
before any birds become visible, but when they finally come
into view, the sight is breathtaking. Hundreds of birds from
dozens of species flit through the air and perch on the tree
limbs. Songbirds swoop after insects or peck at bark while
crows and jays eye them arrogantly and owls stretch their
wings like avian kings. Above, the chamber is open to the
sky, and countless more birds wheel and dive in the opening.
Nature DC 14 or Perception DC 21: Far in the
back of the chamber, shaded by trees and obscured by flitting,
swooping birds, sits a tiny dragon with reddish-brown
scales and a sinewy tail tipped with a stinger. It is watching
the events here intently.
The pseudodragon watches until it’s noticed, until
the characters move away to another chamber, or
until someone takes aim at it. Then it flies to area 15
and alerts the dryad that strangers have come. Any
character who notices the pseudodragon and moves
to investigate the spot where it was finds a nest where
it keeps shiny items that it found in the Colony (see
“Treasure”).
The birds are an annoyance—player characters
must treat every square in the chamber as difficult
terrain, and they are effectively deafened while here.
Aside from those effects, however, the birds aren’t
dangerous.
Treasure: In the pseudodragon’s cache are 54 gp
worth of assorted coins, six items of jewelry worth
400 gp each, a level 9 earthmother torc, and a silverand-
gold-chased scroll tube worth 150 gp. The tube
contains a scroll with the Leomund’s Secret Chest
ritual.
13. Armory
Combat Encounter Level 7 (1,600 XP)
When the Colony was inhabited, this chamber served
as its armory. Much of the arsenal remains hidden
beneath the webs of vicious spiders.
The armory is connected to the Upper Garden
(area 9).
Perception DC 14: Dark shapes lurk throughout
the webs. Every 2 points by which the roll exceeds 14
increases the number seen by one, to a maximum of
five.
Light: Bright light shines through the canopy.
Monsters: 2 deathjump spiders, 3 spider swarms
(see area 9 for statistics).
A huge assortment of rusted weapons lies in a heap in the
middle of the floor. Hanging above them is a great tangle of
spiderwebs.
Perception DC 10: Dozens of birds squawk somewhere
nearby, but not in this chamber.
This encounter happens in two waves. After killing
the spiders in this chamber, the characters are likely
to take a short rest. While they do—before they gain
the benefits of resting—the spiders from area 9 attack.
If characters explore the Upper Garden before the
Armory, then the situation is reversed; the spiders
here attack during the characters’ short rest in area 9.
Webs: Squares containing spiderwebs are difficult
terrain.
Concealed Doorway: A heavy layer of webbing
conceals the doorway connecting this chamber to
area 9. The observer cannot see the doorway if more
than 1 square of webbing lies in between. The spiders,
of course, know exactly where the doorway is.
Treasure: If the characters spend 10 minutes
searching through the debris, they can salvage any
twelve simple or military melee weapons of their
choosing. The weapons aren’t immediately usable,
but they will be as good as new after an hour (each) of
cleaning, sharpening, and repair.
Tactics: The spiders wait until characters move
into the chamber before attacking, if possible. Otherwise,
they fight back as soon as the characters attack
them. If the heroes haven’t already killed them, a
second wave of spiders arrives from area 9 while the
characters try to rest. Spiders pursue characters into
chambers 8, 10, 12, and 14, but no farther.
14. Reflection Room
Exploration Encounter
Phayrd’s followers used this room for quiet reflection.
It is empty and would be quite peaceful if not for the
squawking birds in area 12.
Light: Dim light filters through the canopy.
This chamber has been emptied of everything—even furniture,
if it ever contained any. All that remains here now are
vines and encroaching brush.
Perception DC 10: Dozens of birds squawk somewhere
nearby, but not in this chamber.
15. Sacred Topiary
Roleplaying Encounter or
Combat Encounter Level 1 (200 XP)
The residents maintained a second topiary in this
chamber. Unlike the lower one (area 7), which was
purely decorative, this one served a sacred purpose.
The shaped plants represented important figures
from elven and orc mythology, such as Corellon and
Gruumsh, as well as Phayrd and other key individuals
in the Colony’s heresy.
A dryad recluse now lives among these effigies.
She keeps them trimmed and beautiful, and speaks
to them on moonless nights.
Arcana DC 15: The plants and the chamber are
groomed magically.
Light: Bright light shines through the canopy.
Monsters: Dryad recluse, pseudodragon.
The chamber ahead is a topiary of exquisite beauty. The
carvings are almost perfect in their details. In fact, the
entire chamber is perfectly maintained. No stray plants
creep across the floor, and no climbing vines reach toward
the sun. In fact, the room looks as it must have in the Colony’s
heyday.
A beautiful elf woman steps from behind one of the
green monuments. She wears a flowing gown, and delicate
blossoms accent her pale orange-gold hair. She seems
unaware of anyone’s presence as she tends to the greenery.
Perception DC 16: A tiny dragon with reddish-brown
scales peers out from the wall of trees across the chamber.
Characters can make the following additional skill
checks to discern other features of the area.
History or Religion DC 15: The characters can
identify the canonical figures from myth—Corellon,
Gruumsh, Sehanine, and Lolth, plus a handful of
their most prominent disciples. The monuments representing
Phayrd at several stages of her life, as well
as her mother and her orc stepfather, are unknown to
them, though players might guess their identities.
Perception DC 27: A character sees through the
dryad’s deceptive veil and recognizes her true nature.
Players must make a deliberate attempt to pierce an
illusion to get this Perception check. It is not automatically
allowed.
Any elf, half-elf, or eladrin recognizes the autumnal
tones of the elf ’s hair as an indication of great age.
The dryad’s replies to questions are those of an
amnesiac. She doesn’t recall her name, how long she
has been here, why she is alone, or what this place is.
All she knows is that these trees are important and
it’s her task to tend them, no matter what. She does
not know who they represent, but she is especially
attached to the image of Phayrd.
Most of this response is not a ruse. The dryad lived
here while the Colony thrived, and she narrowly survived
its destruction by teleporting into the forest.
Her grief upon returning to find everyone slaughtered
sent her into a psychotic haze from which she
will never recover. Characters who use Insight to
determine whether the elf is lying can ascertain that
she believes everything she says. The only questions
she evades are those that would reveal that she isn’t
really an elf.
The dryad doesn’t need to be rescued, and she
won’t act as a guide through the Colony.
The dryad grows more and more anxious as the
conversation goes on. She wants the characters to
leave. She repeats that they shouldn’t be here, and the
others shouldn’t be here either. All of them should go
and leave her to tend the trees.
“The others” is a reference to the orcs, who have
arrived and begun exploring the ground level.
The pseudodragon brought her that news, just as it
brought word about the characters.
If the conversation goes on for very long, her
pleas grow more frantic, verging on mania. If the
characters calm her down with Diplomacy or simply
leave, all is well. If they press for information the
dryad is not willing to give, call up frightful memories,
make accusations, or threaten her, she eventually
attacks.
If a fight breaks out, much of the action takes place
in the forest beyond this chamber. Extend that forest as
far as needed in any direction with a blank battle grid.
Forest: Anyone can enter the forest simply by
leaving the area that forms the chamber floor. Forest
squares are difficult terrain. This topiary is 20 feet
above ground level, so characters who step past the
chamber’s floor must fly, teleport from branch to
branch, or climb. The whole forested area is heavily
obscured.
Initiative: If the characters seem determined to
force this pathetic creature into a fight, then be sure
she triggers one. Ask everyone to roll initiative, then
place the dryad at the top of the initiative order.
Tactics: The dryad always stands adjacent to a
plant so she can use treestride. She uses sylvan charm
on whichever character was the most offensive, or the
character she has the best odds against if everyone is
being cruel. (She does not target an eladrin or an elf,
however.) Then she uses treestride to move as far as
possible into the forest, dragging the charmed character
along. On the next few turns, she double moves
with treestride until she has outpaced any pursuers,
who can’t even see her through the foliage.
Once she feels safe, the dryad uses claw against her
hostage. Because of sylvan charm, the character can’t
fight back and can’t run away. A clever player might
find a way out of this situation with a magic item, a
power, or a desperate, lucky Intimidate check. The
other characters hear her captive’s screams and pleas
for mercy. The dryad believes she is killing one of the
Colony’s destroyers, so there is no mercy in her. Be
sure to drop a few hints about the fate of the Colony
into the dryad’s enraged shrieks.
When the dryad is satisfied with her revenge,
she lets the body of her victim tumble through the
branches to the ground, and then she disappears into
the gloom.
Her victim hits the ground unconscious and dying,
but not dead. The rest of the heroes can reach the
body in 3 to 5 rounds if they hurry. Ask for a few Perception
checks to locate the body. If someone spends
an action point or uses a daily power to get there
quicker, reward the player for that act. The timing is
your call; make it exciting. Once they find the body,
the characters can save their friend’s life with Heal
and magic.
Your goal in this fight is not to kill a character, but
to give the players a good scare—along with a lesson in
manners and respect.
The dryad does not stand around to be killed.
She retreats in order to stay alive, with or without a
victim. If the dryad’s first sylvan charm attack misses,
her best move might be to flee without a hostage. Letting
the characters kill her would make the players
think that they’re in control, when they really should
fear this creature.
The pseudodragon takes no part in the fight. At
the first opportunity, it simply shakes its head as if to
say “You should have known better,” then turns invisible
and flies away. (If you prefer for the pseudodragon
to take an active part in this encounter, a stat block is
provided on the next page.)
Further Attacks: The terror doesn’t end after one
attack. If the characters take an extended rest in or
near the Colony to let their injured comrade recover,
or if the dryad retreated from the first fight without a
victim, she might strike again. It’s a simple matter for
her to charm someone as the characters rest or while
they’re distracted and then use treestride to get away.
Repeat the pattern as often as necessary.
16. Shrine Antechamber
Combat Encounter Level 5 (1,000 XP)
Many of the Colony’s residents made their last stand
in this chamber defending the shrine, and here they
died. Some of them are now wraiths, and they continue
defending the shrine indiscriminately against
any who approach.
Light: Dim light filters through the canopy.
Monsters: 5 wraiths.
Even the weedy brush growing here does not completely
obscure the ancient remains that lie in the center of this
chamber. Saplings and ferns grow through rib cages, and
vines twine around the remains of arms, legs, armor, and
pitted weapons. Scars from long-ago scorching are still visible
on surrounding trees.
Heal DC 14: The remains here are a mix of elves and
orcs in almost equal proportion.
Perception DC 14: Most of the skeletons show signs
of heavy blows or cuts, or have metal arrowheads embedded
in them.
Perception DC 21 (or 10 for an elf, half-elf, or
eladrin): The arrowheads in the corpses are all of elven
manufacture.
If the characters kick their way through the bones,
make snide remarks about the corpses, or deliberately
search the bodies for loot, the wraiths attack.
Treasure: The attackers looted the dead thoroughly
in the initial raid, but they overlooked a single
magic implement of level 6 or 7 (of your choosing).
Tactics: The wraiths approach the party quietly
and invisibly to avoid notice. Compare their Stealth
check result to the characters’ passive Perception
scores to determine which characters are surprised.
One wraith attacks each surprised character with
shadow touch during the surprise round.
After that, the wraiths use their invisibility, phasing,
and shadow glide to gang up on one character at
a time. They don’t necessarily gang up on the same
character turn after turn, but they do focus their
efforts against just one enemy each turn, as much
as possible. The wraiths are supremely patient; they
don’t make a poor attack on one turn if they could
phase invisibly into a better position for a coordinated
attack on the next turn. The wraiths fight until
destroyed, but they don’t leave the Upper Canopy.
More than five wraiths exist in this chamber,
but only five fight in the encounter. The others lurk
around the edge of the battle where characters can
notice them, but for now they are only a threatening
presence. If orcs enter this chamber during the final
confrontation, more wraiths stand ready to attack
them.
17. Treasury
Exploration Encounter
The Colony stored its communal wealth here. The
attackers hauled most of it away, but they missed
some key items.
Light: Bright light shines through a gap in the
canopy.
Heavy oak chests lie overturned on the floor, their lids
smashed or hacked apart by a sharp implement. A beautiful
ceramic urn lies shattered amid the weeds where it was
dropped or toppled from a shelf. This room must have been
a storehouse for great wealth once, but now the valuables
are all gone except for a few scattered, overlooked coins.
Not all the Colony’s treasure was kept in plain sight.
This chamber has many secret caches in hollow tree
limbs, beneath tangled vines, in false bottoms of
chests, or camouflaged as mundane items.
Each character who makes a successful DC 21
Perception check while searching the area locates
one of the following treasures of your choosing:
Treasure 1: A silver mirror and matching hairbrush
worth 300 gp.
Treasure 2: Four gems worth 100 gp each.
Treasure 3: Six gold-and-jewel necklaces worth
100 gp each.
Treasure 4: One magic item of level 7 or 8.
18. Vestry
Exploration Encounter
The Colony’s clerics stored vestments and ornaments
for Phayrd’s Shrine (area 19) here. Scraps and tatters
are all that remain. The profusion of new growth conceals
the entrance to the shrine.
Light: Bright light shines through the canopy.
This area is small and brightly lit. So much new growth
in the form of brush and young trees has spread into the
chamber that it’s barely recognizable as ever having been a
usable area.
Perception DC 10: Tatters of silk and cotton vestments
lie strewn around the chamber, largely concealed
beneath the profusion of brush and saplings growing in the
sunlight.
Perception DC 21, Dungeoneering DC 14, or
Nature DC 10: A downward staircase circles a tree near
the back of the chamber, but overgrowth blocks access to it.
Cutting a hole big enough to climb through will take several
minutes.
19. Shrine
Exploration Encounter
The Colony’s shrine to Phayrd was once green and
beautiful. Now it’s a burned and blasted sepulcher
for the former high cleric, whose body conceals an
important clue.
Light: Dim light filters through the canopy.
Trap: The elves who demolished the Colony left
behind a glyph of warding in case anyone who escaped
into the forest ever came back here. Located in the
square at the base of the stairs, the glyph detonates
when the second character in the group steps off the
stairs onto that square. The burst is large enough to
encompass everyone on the stairs.
When the characters reach this chamber, read:
The smell of burning lingers in this chamber, even after so
many intervening decades. All the surfaces of the room are
deeply scarred by fire and lightning.
Lashed to a scorched bench that leans against the wall is
a badly decayed body.
Healing DC 14 or Perception DC 21: A wink of
light glints from something in the corpse’s stomach area.
Further investigation reveals that the glinting item is
a brass key. Characters can learn the following information
by making the appropriate skill checks.
Arcana DC 14 (to detect magic): The key has a
faint magical aura. It provides a link to a chest that
was hidden with the Leomund’s Secret Chest ritual.
Heal DC 10: The body is that of a female elf. At
least one assailant tortured her severely, then stabbed
her to death.
The body is that of the highest-ranking cleric of
Phayrd in the Colony. The attacking elves captured
her, lashed her to the bench, and tried to make her
reveal the location of any hidden treasures or relics of
Phayrd, which they suspected must exist. She refused
to tell them anything and died with her secret safe—
namely that she had swallowed the key to the hidden
reliquary.
Key: The object in the cleric’s stomach is a delicate
brass key with a head carved from a finger bone
(a true relic of Phayrd). The carving resembles an
elf ’s face on one side and an orc’s face on the other.
Whoever holds the key has the personal link necessary
to summon the Colony’s reliquary, a chest that
was hidden using the Leomund’s Secret Chest ritual.
(A scroll containing this ritual lies in the pseudodragon’s
nest in the Aviary. Move the scroll to some
other location if your players aren’t inclined to search
a pseudodragon’s nest.)
With the key, a scroll containing the ritual, 140 gp
worth of arcane components, and 5 minutes, anyone
can summon the chest to his or her current location.
A character who has mastered the level 6 ritual does
not need the scroll.
Phayrd’s Reliquary: The reliquary is a locked
iron chest. The key opens the lock, or it can be picked
with a DC 23 Thievery check. The inside of the chest
is 20 inches from side to side, 16 inches from front to
back, and 12 inches deep.
Treasure: The reliquary contains four items
that reputedly belonged to Phayrd—the First Truth
from the Book of Five Truths, a crown of leaves, and two
more magic items of level 5 to 8 that you choose. The
chest also contains the Scriptures of Phayrd, which
relate in detail the legend of Phayrd as her followers
understood it. The scriptures end with a final note
indicating that the priestess believed that warriors
from the nearby temple of Corellon and Kord would
soon attack the Colony, and that she doubted her
community was strong enough to win such a battle.
The reliquary is valuable as a safe storage place, provided
that characters have access to the Leomund’s
Secret Chest ritual.
Showdown
The climax of the adventure occurs when the characters
have explored most of the Colony, learned what secrets
they can, and then come upon Venak’s war band.
Venak is an orc storm shaman (level 6 controller).
Though he is not the strongest orc in this war
party, he commands it because of the mission’s
unique nature and the superstitious fears that all orcs
share. Some of the more powerful warriors resent
his authority, though, and they’re willing to follow
Venak as long his orders steer them toward victory. If
the characters deliver a few setbacks, the orcs might
begin feuding among themselves in ways that the
characters can exploit.
Venak does not have a fixed number of orcs under
his control—many small bands are currently prowling
through this forest. Therefore, reinforcements
can come and go as you wish. The woods are so thick
that characters should never have a clear idea of
how many orcs they’re facing. They hear orc voices
grunting somewhere nearby, catch the sounds of rattling
weapons and armor, and occasionally glimpse a
moving shadow. It should be clear that they’re facing
a superior force, but the closest estimate of enemy
strength they can make is “a lot.”
The final confrontation can develop in dozens of
different ways. You should have at least three strong
battles out of the orcs. For example, you could open
with a surprise encounter against an exploring party,
let the characters beat back an assault, and finish with
a desperate breakout. Alternatively, you could begin
with scouts, move to an abortive attempt to break out
that Venak’s reinforcements prevent, allow some characters
to set traps while others negotiate with Venak,
and then let the orcs dash themselves to pieces in a
running battle through the heroes’ gauntlet.
How this encounter plays out depends largely on
the players. Let them make their own plans without
trying to steer them onto any predetermined
course, but do not let them break out too soon. If they
make an immediate dash for freedom, bring a steady
stream of orc reinforcements into the fight to turn the
heroes back. Make it clear that they must weaken the
orcs a bit before a direct rush can succeed.
A few orc scouts (archers and savages) arrive
shortly after the characters have dealt with Angrad
Nénharma. Events should build from there, with
more orcs arriving while the characters explore. The
exact staging and pacing are up to you.
Simultaneous Exploration: Several routes up and
down through the Colony exist. If the characters move
slowly, the orcs could get ahead of them. Both groups
might be startled when they bump into each other.
Typical advance squad: 2 orc savages, 2 orc archers,
1 orc rampager (level 2 encounter, 688 XP).
Flag of Truce: Venak wants to know what the
characters learned in the Colony. He can’t afford to
kill them until he knows whether they destroyed or
concealed vital evidence. To find out, he might offer
to negotiate under a white flag. This situation gives
both sides a chance to gauge the opposition, rest,
regroup, or maneuver for position. Venak doesn’t
intend to let the characters escape no matter how
negotiations turn out, but there’s no telling what
might happen when enemies sit down to talk. (That’s
what Phayrd would have said, anyway.)
Breakout: Venak can summon reinforcements,
surround the Colony, and wait for the characters to
get hungry and thirsty. Characters might try to fight
their way through such a cordon before overwhelming
reinforcements arrive.
Typical cordon squad: 2 orc savages, 2 orc archers, 1
orc rampager; an additional 1 orc storm shaman and
1 orc pummeler arrive on turn 3 (level 5 encounter,
1,188 XP). Use a stronger force if your goal is to drive
the characters back into the Colony.
Assault: If Venak is impatient or feels confident
in his strength, he can order an immediate assault
against the Colony. The orcs aren’t limited to arriving
through chambers. They can climb into the trees and
attack upper levels from any direction, but such an
attack is poorly coordinated.
Typical assault squad: 2 orc savages, 2 orc archers, 1
orc rampager, 1 orc storm shaman, 1 ogre mercenary
(level 6 encounter, 1,288 XP).
Running Battle: A climactic battle can shift from
chamber to chamber as the orcs come through walls
to push back or outflank characters, or as the heroes
seek stronger defensive positions. In a running battle,
the orc force should seem overwhelming (as indeed
it might be). By keeping on the move, characters can
force a powerful enemy force to string out, to pile
up at choke points, and to make long, time-wasting
detours toward the characters’ flanks, only to find
their foes gone when the flanking force arrives. This
tactic is especially effective as long as the orcs don’t
know the Colony’s layout—the orcs don’t run or make
double moves through unknown areas for fear of
losing their bearings in the eerie surroundings.
Typical running battle squad: 2 orc savages, 2 orc
archers, 1 orc rampager, 2 orc storm shamans
(including Venak), 1 orc pummeler, 1 ogre mercenary
(level 8 encounter, 1,788 XP).
Traps and Ambushes: With time to prepare,
characters could set traps and then lure orcs into
them during a running battle.
Allies: If the characters befriended the dryad or
at least left her in peace, they can eliminate a few
orcs by luring them to the Sacred Topiary, where the
dryad willingly takes care of the problem. The spiders
in areas 9 and 13 can become ersatz allies, if the
heroes didn’t kill them all and the orcs don’t know
about them. Finally, the characters might lure orcs
into the shadowy arms of the wraiths in area 16.
