The Forgotten Tomb, the players happen upon an old tomb with symbols of Moradin about it's surface and have to deal with it's new "guardian."

## Forgotten
The players discover an abandoned shrine formerly dedicated to the dwarven god Moardin.

Read or paraphrase the following when they reach the area of the shrine:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The barren stretch of valley before you suddenly becomes filled with vermin.  Centipedes of all shapes and sizes skitter toward and around a ruined shire in the distance. 

# Approaching the Ruins
As the PCs approach the area of the shrine it becomes apparent that something strange is happening.  The area around the entrance to the small building is completely free of vermin while the immediate area and the building itself are crawling with the creatures.

Read the following:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> While the ground crawls with insects you find the area around the entrance to be oddly free of vermin.

# Encounter 1 - The Entrance
**Encounter Difficulty:** None

As the players enter the shrine an unnatural cold and sense of foreboding begins to wrap itself around them.

When the PCs enter this room, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> It is eerily silent here.  Like the noise from the outside isn't allowed to pervade this area.  As you move about this chamber an unnatural cold and sense of foreboding begin to wash over you.  It seems to be emanating from from the room to your right.  About the room are skeletons devoid of even scraps of flesh and clothing.  Those closest to the opening how a rime of frost about them.  To your left is a stout oaken door seemingly untouched by the ravages of time.  It does not appear to have a handle but there is a large key hold directly in the center of the door.

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** The only light is from the open door to the outside and what is allowed in from there.

**Ceiling:** The ceiling in this area is 15 feet high.

**Skeletons:** The skeletons in the room are truly dead.  They have no items or even bits of flesh and clothing.

# Encounter 2 - Through the Chill
**Encounter Difficulty:** Severe (120 xp)
Creatures:
 - 1: [[giant-spectral-centipede|Giant Spectral Centipede]]

```encounter
name: The Study
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 1: [[Giant Spectral Centipede]]
- Ice Crystal, 72, 21, 12, hidden
- Tail Stinger, 72, 21, 12, hidden
- Antenna, 72, 21, 12, hidden
```

The PCs enter the room and find it littered with more bare skeletal corpses. There is, however, one exception.  Slumped against the far wall is the mostly intact corpse of a gnoll.  Slowly moving, almost gliding, about the floor and the walls of the room is a large translucent centipede.  It won't pay them any interest until they begin to interact with it's "prize."

As the PCs enter this room, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> This stone chamber freezing and illuminated by a faint cold-white light.  Much like the room before it, skeletons bare of clothing or flesh scraps litter the room.  A heavy rime of frost covers everything here.  Against the far wall you see the almost fully intact form of a gnoll.  The centipede slowing traverses the room almost gliding along the floor and walls of this space.  A blue-white crystal on its chest is what gives off the faint light.  The creature seems to pay you no head and you enter.

[[skills#Perception|Perception]] DC 15
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> You also notice this centipede while large is not like other centipedes you've seen.  It's antenna seem to phase in and out as it moves about.  A fine mist plays off them and seems to wrap around the creature.  The blue-white crystal on it chest, in addition to providing a dim light, seems to pulsate with cold.  This pulsating is obviously pumping some kind of fluid down the outside of it's carapace to it's mandibles and down it's belly to a deadly looking stinger on it's tail.  The tail stinger almost seems to be an after thought as it relates to the rest of the creatures form.  Yes, deadly, but also fragile.

## Tactics
The centipede will not attack the players unless they attempt to interact with the gnoll.  It is instinctually repulsed by the gnoll due to a broken and slowly leaking [[potion-of-resistance|Potion of Resistance - Cold]].  However, as a result, it sees the gnoll as a special prize and is not willing to share.  During combat with the centipede what for the following events.

If the players sever the Tail Stinger, 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Suddenly the centipede snaps it's tail hard and it slams against the ground.  The end if it's tail with the stinger bounces off into the corner of the room.

If the Ice Crystal is shattered, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A crack appears in the crystal quickly followed by a spider web of others.  Suddenly it explodes outward spraying a cold blue-ish liquid across everything directly in front of it.  The veins running up and down the centipede's body fade in color and you know they will no longer be providing the creature with it's cold based attacks.

If the Antenna are destroyed, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> With the antenna's destroyed the mist no longer protects the centipede and it completely takes on solid form.

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** The centipede provides dim light to the room.  However, once the crystal on it's chest is destroyed that light disappears.  Unless the PCs have another light source the room with be completely dark.

**Ceiling:** The ceiling in this area is 15 feet high.

**The Gnoll:** The body of a gnoll lies against the far wall.  It has survived this long, thanks to a potion of resistance which was cracked during it's struggle with the centipede.  That steady drip has caused the creature to be repulsed and to leave it alone.  Amongst it's remaining possessions (a rotting suit of hide armor and a rusty broadsword), players find a large obviously dwarven forged key.

**Skeletons:** The skeletons in the room are truly dead.  They have no items or even bits of flesh and clothing.

# Encounter 3 - Into the Tomb
The PCs enter the tomb.  It appears to have been undisturbed for quite some time. A thin layer of dust covers the room.  Two unlit braziers flank a sarcophagus.

Read the following to the players:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> This is a tomb and not a shrine.  It appears to be dedicated to a champion of Moradin.  A thin layer of dust covers the room.  Two unlit braziers flank a simple stone sarcophagus carved with symbols of Moradin on a raised platform opposite the door.

Once the players remove the cover of the sarcophagus, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Inside you see a dwarven corpse he's wearing a suit of splint mail with a pair of battle axes crossing on it's chest.  It also wears a mithril circlet emblazoned with the symbol of Moradin.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> The equipment found in the sarcophagus is magical.  The players find a holy relic of Moradin (the circlet), [[resilient|+1 Resilient Splint Mail]], [[ghost-touch|+1 Ghost Touch Battle Axe]] and a [[silver|Low-Grade Silver Battle Axe]].

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** Complete darkness.

**Ceiling:** The ceiling in this area is 15 feet high.

**Braziers:** The braziers contain oil and can be lit providing the room with regular illumination.

> [!warning]
> If the players take the time to renew and/or reconsecrate the tomb award them 80 xp and a bonus hero card.
