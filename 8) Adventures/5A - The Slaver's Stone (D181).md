![[The Slavers Stone.webp]]

# Background
A few days ago, a wereboar slaver named Magrak Ironjaw attacked the remote village of Cled to capture prisoners he intended to sell as slaves. Magrak, his own troops, plus those of the Proud Boys bandits, led the prisoners across the King’s Wall and into the scar, bound for the Slaver’s Stone not far from the valley mouth. There, he hopes to offload the chattel to an orc chieftain who is known to be a good customer for slavers. 

Hot on the wereboar’s heels, however, is Cluff Maclire, chief and warleader at Cled. He nearly caught the slaver, but lost Magrak’s trail at the King’s Wall. Cluff then traveled to Restwell Keep, where he hopes to round up support from Lord Drysdale to rescue his people.

## Adventure Synopsis
The adventure begins at Restwell Keep. There, the characters run across Cluff, who asks them for help after being rebuffed by the bailiff, who wants no trouble with the notorious slaver. Cluff, with his own warriors, the characters, and a guide named Zestren, heads into the Chaos Scar to pick up the bandits’ trail. The expedition winds up at the Crossroads where the Proud Boys, who parted ways with the wereboar, are camped. From them, the characters learn where Magrak was headed.

The adventurers can then move to intercept the slaver band. They nearly catch up with them at the Stone Forest, a blighted area of petrified trees, but are delayed by several harpies. Magrak, it appears, offered the harpies a sacrifice—a young woman—to gain safe passage through their territory. If the characters rescue her, they can learn important information about how to defeat the wereboar before he gets to the Slaver’s Stone. That night, however, Zestren makes off with the captive and hauls her to the oracle at Cloven Skull. Cluff, dismayed, must choose to either follow the traitor or to push on to rescue the greater number of his folk.

# Running the Adventure
> [!info]- GM Only
> BE CAREFUL WITH THIS ADVENTURE!
> 
> Don't forget to add Zestren and Cluff as Players in the initiative tracker. Keep track of the minions.  As the die they will need to be removed from each encounter and the adventure difficulty/xp will need to be adjusted.

## The Consequences of Time
Cautious adventurers might take one or more rests during the adventure. This is bad news for the poor prisoners, because the villains aren’t going to put their plans on hold for 8 hours. Luckily, extended resting shouldn’t be necessary thanks to the Companions (see below). Still, the adventurers might take their time, and if they do, they face specific consequences.

**First Rest:** Cluff and the minions abandon the party unless the characters can persuade them otherwise. You should run this as a complexity 1 skill challenge involving DC 17 [[skills#diplomacy|Diplomacy]] or [[skills#Intimidation|Indimidation]] checks. Success means Cluff sticks around. Failure means he doesn’t, resorting to combat if he must.

**Second Rest:** The captive at the Stone Forest is eaten. Add 1 orc chieftain (Monster Manual, page 204) and 8 orc warriors (Monster Manual, page 203) to Tactical Encounter 3: Chain Gang.

**Third Rest:** Magrak sells all the prisoners at the Slaver’s Stone and is gone by the time the adventurers reach the place. The characters have failed. They might rescue the prisoners from the orc chieftain, though how this might play out is up to you.

## Zestren
Zestren joins Cluff Maclire’s expedition at Restwell Keep. He claims to know the land around the Scar well. Zestren has an ulterior motive in joining the group, however—he intends on betraying them.

The eladrin is desperate to learn the fate of Riddle, his lover who was lost during another adventure long ago. Riddle was swallowed up in a dark portal beneath a ruined keep. Zestren has spent his time trying to recover his lover with little luck. His efforts eventually put him on the path to the Lake Oracle who lived just outside the Scar in a cave known as the Cloven Skull. Zestren convinced himself the oracle was the only path to Riddle and thus sought her out.

When he reached the site, he was barred passage to her by a pair of wicked ghouls who demanded a living sacrifice before they would allow him passage. Zestren withdrew and stewed on their demand the long weeks since. The more he thought on it, the more convinced he became that it was the only way. When he heard of Cluff ’s predicament, he was certain it would give him the means to acquire a suitable sacrifice while still doing some good.

Zestren plans to abduct a rescued prisoner at some point during the journey and bring the captive to the ghouls as a sacrifice. Zestren is not completely committed to the plan and has not yet worked out how it will happen, so he is not beyond saving. If the opportunity presents itself, however, Zestren will take it and complete his slide into evil.

### Minor Quest : Stop Zestren’s Treachery
Unless stopped, Zestren steals a captive and makes off for the Cloven Skull to learn what secrets he can from the oracle. The adventurers can foil this plot by uncovering his true motives or stopping him from escaping with a prisoner.

**Quest XP:** 
- [ ] Quest (20 XP) for each member of the group.

## Companions
Two companion characters, Cluff and Zestren, plus ten minions join the characters’ adventuring group. Divide the minions between the players but consider controlling the two companion characters yourself. If you have too much to handle already, you can assign these characters to the players, but be sure to keep Zestren’s motives secret. A handout at the end of this adventure contains all the statistics for these characters. If Zestren becomes an enemy, use his statistics as given on page 11.

> [!tip]+ Skill Challenge
> # Something about Zestren
> The characters have several opportunities to talk with Zestren before his betrayal. Learning more about him and winning his friendship can reveal what he intends. This skill challenge takes place over several hours and can be run during short rests or through roleplaying while the party travels.
> 
> **Level:** 7 (20 xp)
> **Complexity:** 1 (requires 4 successes before 3 failures)
> **Primary Skills:**  [[skills#Arcana|Arcana]], [[skills#Deception|Deception]], [[skills#diplomacy|Diplomacy]], [[sense-motive|Perception: Sense Motive]] 
> **Secondary Skills:** [[skills#Arcana|Arcana]]
> 
> ## Primary Skills
> **Arcana (DC 27; 1 success, 1 successes max):** The character identifies Zestren as a magus and recalls something useful about magus training, which can provide the character with a topic to discuss with Zestren (and allow for further bonding). Magus gain a +5 bonus to this check.
> 
> **Deception (DC 25; 1 success, 2 successes max):** A character uses false pretenses to learn more about Zestren. The first success reveals that he was an adventurer whose party met a terrible end beneath a ruined keep. A second success softens him up and he reveals a bit about Riddle, his lost love, though he keeps secret his efforts to recover her. A failed Deception check results in two failures, closes off the Deception skill for the duration of the challenge, and increases all other DCs by 2.
> 
> **Diplomacy (DC 25; 1 success, 4 successes max):** A character tries to befriend Zestren. The first two successful checks reveal the same information as described under Deception. The third check reveals a general dislike for humans over the fact that a human was responsible for Riddle’s apparent demise. A third or fourth success by the same character establishes a strong connection so that Zestren does not attack that character unless he is first attacked.
> 
> **Perception: Sense Motive (DC 17; 1 success, 2 successes max):** The character senses that Zestren is uneasy, and the uneasiness grows as the party travels into the Chaos Scar. A critical success grants an extra success and also identifies that Zestren is grieving. A character gains a bonus to Diplomacy checks made during this challenge equal to the number of successes earned from Sense Motive checks.
> 
> ## Secondary Skills
> **Arcana (DC 27; 1 success, 1 successes max):** The character identifies Zestren as a magus and recalls something useful about magus training, which can provide the character with a topic to discuss with Zestren (and allow for further bonding). Magus gain a +5 bonus to this check.
> 
> ## Success
> The character or characters gain Zestren’s trust and he divulges his whole sorry tale, including his terrible plan. He accepts any solution the characters put forward—killing the ghouls, offering a villain as a sacrifice, or something else.
> 
> ## Failure 
> Zestren goes through with the plan. Also, add 1 cackling harpy to Tactical Encounter 2: Stone Forest.
- [ ] Challenge (20 XP)

The adventure begins in Restwell Keep. The party can be at the Keep for a variety of reasons, such as picking up supplies, gathering information about another lead, or simply taking some well-deserved downtime between expeditions. Once the adventurers conduct all their business, introduce them to Cluff Maclire. Cluff is at the following locations at the indicated times.

- **Main Gate (late morning):** Cluff and his warriors enter the community to speak with the bailiff. 
- **Bailiff’s Tower (late morning):** The bailiff, who wants nothing to do with Magrak Ironjaw, informs Cluff that he intends to send out a force to deal with the slaver and then never does.
- **Fountain Square (midday):** Cluff makes a scene by haranguing locals about Magrak Ironjaw and what he did to Cluff ’s folk—namely how the brute stole their women and burned down their huts. After a few minutes of this, [[Kendon Longstrider]] and a handful of guards come in and break up the assembly to scattered applause. Cluff storms away to drink off his rage at the Stumbling Giant.
- **The Stumbling Giant (afternoon until morning):** Cluff and company knock back grog at the Giant. As the hours wear on, their sobriety diminishes until the entire band passes out sometime after midnight.

### Talking with Cluff
The characters should run across Cluff in the Keep. Make it clear that he’s an unhappy man on a mission. Characters who approach him should learn the following bits of information.

- Cluff Maclire is the chief of Clan Maclire, a proud warrior tribe with a settlement several leagues to the north “as the crow flies.”
- A few days back while Cluff and the warriors were orc-hunting, a coward named Magrak Ironjaw raided the settlement, “burning all our homes and stealing the women who chose to stay behind.” He knows it was Magrak because “the women gave as good as they got and the coward left his dead and dying behind for our questioning.”
- Cluff is sure he can find the slaver at the Crossroads. He intends to head there first thing in the morning and “give that brigand the killing he’s earned.”

Any interest expressed by the characters about Cluff ’s predicament results in the chieftain pushing hard to recruit the adventurers to help him. At first, he runs with the honor bit—“An honorable warrior could see the righteousness of our cause.” If that fails, he resorts to guilt—“You wouldn’t doom innocents to an unspeakable fate, would you?” Finally, he settles for insults—“Well, I can see you lack the stones to go with real warriors. When we get back, I’ll teach you the basics of how to handle a spear.” If none of those efforts works, Cluff and Zestren leave with their small group of warriors but without the characters.

Three days later, one of those warriors returns to describe how the expedition ended in ruin. Led by their guide Zestren, a few of the best hunters sneaked into the slavers’ camp at night and freed just one person, a young woman. Cluff hoped that she could provide information that would help the warriors defeat the slavers and release all the captives. Before the warriors could strike in force, harpies ambushed them at the Stone Forest. During that fight, Zestren and the rescued woman ran off, leaving everyone else to their fate.

As word of this spreads, Lord Drysdale raises the bounty for Magrak Ironjaw’s head to 110 gp and also offers 50 gp for Zestren’s head.

### Magrak Ironjaw
Magrak Ironjaw is a warrior, slaver, and bandit. Because of his depredations, Lord Drysdale has offered a 110 gp bounty for Ironjaw’s head. Few people have tried to hunt him down, and those who have never return. Magrak is a wereboar. He runs with a mixed band of orcs, half-orcs, and other scum. Because he provides a needed commodity (slaves), he comes and goes as he pleases in the Chaos Scar.

## On the Way
Reaching the Crossroads involves following the old trail toward the Chaos Scar. The characters might encounter a few locals along the way. Consider injecting one or two of the following encounters during the trek to the Crossroads.

### Escaped Prisoner
- [x] Trivial (60 XP)

One of Magrak’s prisoners, a handsome young woman from Cled, escaped the wereboar. Unfortunately, Magrak dispatched his warriors to chase her down. Once the characters defeat the pursuers, then find the woman, Allysen can tell the adventurers that Magrak is headed for some place called the Slaver’s Stone, though she doesn’t know where that is. Cluff, if with the party, sends two warriors to escort her back to their lands.

- 4 [[orc-raider|Orc Raider]] 

```encounter
name: Escaped Prisoner
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 6: [[Orc Raider]] 
```

The party encounters two bands of of warriors searching for Cled.  While the party handles one of them Cluff's mercenaries will handle the other.  They will win this combat with only minor injuries to show for it.

### Howling Pack
- [x] Trivial (60 XP)
A gnoll band spills across the countryside to attack the adventurers. They are undeterred by the characters’ greater numbers. The gnolls’ erratic behavior comes from the meal they made on strange mushrooms found in a nearby glade.

- 4 [[gnoll-warfang|Gnoll Warfang]]
- 2 [[gnoll-hunter|Gnoll Hunter]]
- 4 [[hyena|Hyena]]

```encounter
name: Howling Pack
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 4: [[Gnoll Warfang]] 
- 2: [[Gnoll Hunter]]
- 4: [[Hyena]]
```

A second gnoll band will emerge from over a hill in the round following the encounter with the first.  Cluff's mercenaries will move to intercept them and again will emerge with only minor wounds to show from the battle.

## Roaming Dead
- [ ] Trivial (60 XP)
A reckless necromancer was killed when he tried to raise an undead army. The results of his foolish ritual now roam the Chaos Scar.

- 1 [[tyrannosaurus-skeleton|Tyrannosaurus Skeleton]]
- 2 [[hunter-wight|Hunter Wight]]

```encounter
name: Howling Pack
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 1: [[Tyrannosaurus Skeleton]] 
- 2: [[Hunter Wight]]
```

During the combat a small band of zombies will join the battle.  Cluff's mercernaries will again move to handle the situation.  They will once more emerge mostly unharmed from the battle. 

## 1.  Crossroads
The Crossroads are beyond the King’s Wall, about halfway to the Chaos Scar, at the juncture of the main trail and a second, smaller trail that leads to the north. 

When the characters approach the Crossroads, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The muddy path leads to a road junction where you see a wooden fort and a couple of buildings. A large, metal construction stands to one side, and from it hang iron cages. Ravens clot the cages, gorging themselves on the contents.

The Proud Boys gang camps near the trading post. They are cruel brigands who sometimes work with Magrak when he needs more muscle than his own team can provide. The bandits accompanied Magrak on his last expedition but split off from him to spend their pay at the trading post.

The characters can beat the information they need from the brigands and, in fact, this might be the best approach. In that case, go to [[#Encounter 1 Local Color]].

Alternatively, cautious adventurers might try talking (or, they might beat the needed information from a captive after defeating the bandits). In that case, run the “Interrogating the Brigands” skill challenge. If parley occurs first, the bandit captain, a wily half-elf named Carrus, does the talking. Carrus is unpleasant, has a foul mouth, and a leering eye. Otherwise, the same information can come from any of the bandits. Characters gain a +2 bonus to Intimidate checks if they defeat the bandits first.

> **Secondary Skills:** None
> 
> ### Primary Skills
> **Deception (DC 27, One Minute, 1 success, 2 successes maximum):** A character uses deception to winkle out the truth. The first success reveals the bandits are called the Proud Boys and that they “ain’t afraid o’ no ’venturers.” A second success gets them to admit they know Magrak Ironjaw, “jes saw ’im the day a’fore.” A critical success results in an extra success. A failed check nets a failure and closes off Deception to future use.
> 
> **Society (DC 27, One Minute, 1 success, 1 success maximum):** A character recalls some exploit attributed to the Proud Boys. A successful check reveals the Boys are a gang who sometimes join forces with more powerful groups. A critical success lets the character remember the Boys once double-crossed an ogre named Blath and it’s said he still has an axe to grind against them. This information grants the character a +2 bonus to Deception and Intimidate checks for the duration of the challenge.
> 
> **Sense Motive (DC 24, One Minute, 1 success, 1 success maximum):** The character reads the bandits. A successful check reveals they are intimidated by numbers and might respond to violence.
> 
> **Intimidation (DC 27, One Minute, 1 success, 2 successes maximum):** The character uses threats to start them talking with the same results as described under Deception.
>
> **Special:** A character that kills a Proud Boy bandit gets their attention and earns the heroes 1 success. Killing a second bandit earns 1 failure and ends the skill challenge in failure if it happens before the combat.
> 
> ### Success
> The captain (or prisoner) reveals that they had hooked up with Magrak and helped raid a settlement beyond the wall. Magrak paid them and left them here. They think Magrak is headed to the Slaver’s Stone, “just beyond the Stone Forest.” They can provide directions. After the heroes depart, the bandits track them and attack the first time the heroes camp to rest.
> 
> ### Failure 
> If the failure comes before combat, the bandits attack. If it comes after, the adventurers learn the same information as above, but the bandits follow them and attack while the heroes are engaged against the harpies in Tactical Encounter 2: Dung and Feathers.
- [ ] Challenge (20 XP)

## The Stone Forest
The Stone Forest is not an actual forest but rather a collection of monoliths set here by people unknown for purposes unknown. Some claim they are teeth liberated from a primordial’s mouth by a deft swing of Moradin’s hammer. Curious origins aside, the Stone Forest is a popular roosting place for a band of harpies, who make it their business to torment folk coming and going from the Scar. Most locals tolerate their presence and bullying demands. Magrak is just such a local, and he offered one of his captives to silence the shrieking flock.

The Stone Forest stands between the Slaver’s Stone and the Crossroads. The group can circumvent it easily, but trekking off the trail invites contact with other things haunting these parts (see “[[#On the Way]],” above, for possibilities). In any event, the heroes are bound to hear the shrieking cries and the shouted curses from their captive.

Adventurers passing through learn the harpies’ demand. Groups can pass freely if they offer up one of their members (a minion will do), a pile of gold (at least 5 gp per traveler), or some other valuable trinket. The harpies readily betray Magrak, telling the adventurers, if they ask, that he came this way. The harpies attack anyone who refuses to pay for their passage. Under no circumstances will they release their prisoner voluntarily.

Go to Tactical [[#Encounter 2: Dung and Feathers]].

### Betrayal
If the adventurers haven’t yet uncovered [[Zestren|Zestren's]] sinister motives by the time the combat starts, [[Zestren]] uses the chaos in the battle to snatch [[#Lysa, the Prisoner|Lysa]] and make off with her. [[Zestren]] attacks the woman, knocking her unconscious. He then races off to the north to hand her over to the ghouls.

If the characters stop [[Zestren]] and take him alive, they can get his story. Use the “Something about Zestren” skill challenge, substituting Intimidate for Diplomacy and fear for friendship. On the other hand, if [[Zestren]] escapes with [[#Lysa, the Prisoner|Lysa]], the characters must decide whether to give chase or to confront Magrak. [[Cluff Maclire]], assuming he’s still alive, argues they should press on (one life is not worth the dozen he hopes to save). He does not, however, stop the characters from going to rescue [[#Lysa, the Prisoner|Lysa]], saying he hopes to “see them once they settle that business.”

> [!tip]+ Skill Challenge
> # Pursuing Zestren
> 
> The adventurers might chase Zestren straightaway, in which case they have a chance to stop him before he reaches the Cloven Skull, or they might wait until the Magrak matter is concluded, thus consigning poor Lysa to certain death. The following skill challenge applies in either situation.

The characters run to catch up with the elf if chasing him or must overcome some natural obstacle while tracking him. This is a group skill check with a success earned if half or more of the party succeeds on their individual checks. Failure for the group earns both 1 failure and 1 success.
> 
> **Perception (DC 27, or 24 if tracking; variable time; 1 success, 2 successes maximum):** A character tries to keep Zestren in sight or follow his tracks. Up to four characters can aid on this check.
> 
> **Survival (DC 27, group check; variable time;  1 success, maximum 1 success):** A Survival group check must be attempted, and it can be attempted only once. The terrain is challenging, and the characters must struggle against its manifold hardships. This is a group skill check with a success earned if half or more of the party succeeds on their individual checks. Failure for the group earns both 1 failure and 1 success.
> 
> ### Success
> If chasing, the characters catch up with Zestren, who surrenders and reveals the whole story. He begs the characters to help him pass by the guardians so he can speak with the oracle.
> 
> ### Failure 
> The characters find the Cloven Skull but get there too late to save Lysa. Proceed with “Seer in the Water,” below.
- [ ] Challenge (20 XP)

### Lysa, the Prisoner
Assuming Lysa survives, she proves helpful. She is a strong-willed woman with brown hair and blue eyes, and she wears a torn shirt and skirt. She has a fiery disposition and a no-nonsense way about her. She knows the following:
- Magrak is headed to the Slaver’s Stone, where he’s to meet an orc chieftain named Po to whom he hopes to offload his captives.
- The numbers and composition of Magrak’s forces.
- That the Proud Boys were involved in the attack on Cled.

Lysa is not about to go home. She joins [[Cluff Maclire|Cluff's]] forces, picking up spare armor and weapons from her cohorts.

## Slaver’s Stone
The Slaver’s Stone takes its name for the business conducted on the high, flat stone. Magrak named it himself. Magrak arrives at the Stone early and must wait several hours for the orc chieftain, Po, to arrive. If the characters arrive in time, which they do if they’ve been smart with their rests (see “[[#The Consequences of Time]]”), they can catch the wereboar without the orcs to give him trouble. In this situation, allow the characters to see the camp and where the creatures are positioned. The characters can use [[skills#Stealth|Stealth]] against the sentries’ passive [[skills#Perception|Perception]] to move into position and, most likely, take the entire camp by surprise.

Go to Tactical [[#Encounter 3: Chain Gang.]]

## The Lake Oracle
Although tangential to the main plot, the characters might have cause to visit the seer of the Cloven Skull depending on how the story with Zestren plays out. The Lake Oracle is an insane steel dragon, driven mad through exposure to exposure to chaos crystals long ago. The dragon hides in the Chaos Scar to escape the voices and visions she experienced and now lairs in a dark cavern. She subsists on the blindfish swimming in the underground lake where she makes her home and has little to no contact with the other creatures found in her lair.

Zestren knows the location of the Cloven Skull and can lead the characters there. Otherwise, the adventurers might come across the site through happenstance, to seek out answers to their own queries, or to deal with the evil believed to linger here. Although the oracle might be dealt with without combat, the self-styled guardians are dangerous.

### The Cloven Skull
The Cloven Skull is a queer rock formation in the side of the mountains forming the Chaos Scar and, as one might expect, it appears to be an enormous human skull chiseled from the stone and with a dark gap in the center.

Go to Tactical [[#Encounter 4: Guardians of the Skull]].

### Seer in the Water
Beyond the ghouls at the Cloven Skull, the characters find a cramped, winding passage burrowing deep into the mountain. The tunnel leads more or less straight to the oracle. When the adventurers reach the end, they are on the pebbled shore overlooking a broad, wide lake teeming with pale crustaceans and darting blindfish. Some distance away is the small, rocky island where the oracle makes her home.

If combat breaks out, go to Tactical [[#Encounter: 5 Eyes in the Dark]].

Heroes approaching the Lake Oracle with more discretion, however, can instead try to persuade the dragon to reveal a secret, foretell an event, or provide some other bit of information the characters need to learn. If the characters take this approach, run the “Consulting the Oracle” skill challenge.

> ### Primary Skills
> **Arcana (DC 22; 5 minutes; 1 success, maximum 1 success):** The character identifies the chaos shard influences in the dragon. A successful check, in addition to counting as a success, grants a +2 bonus to Deceptoin checks related to the challenge.
> 
> **Deception (DC 25; 1 minute; 1 success, maximum 4 successes):** The character lies about the reason for wanting the knowledge. For every 10 points by which the check succeeds, the character earns an extra success. Each failed check, in addition to counting as a failure, increases the DC for all skill checks related to the challenge by 2.
> 
> **Diplomacy (DC 17; 5 minutes; 1 success, maximum 4 successes):** The character makes an impassioned plea to the dragon, explaining the information’s importance. For every 10 points by which the check succeeds, the character earns an extra success. This skill can be used to gain 4 successes in this challenge.
> 
> **Perception (DC 15; 5 minutes; 1 success, maximum 1 success):** The character tries to ascertain the dragon’s desires. A success reveals the dragon is quite mad. A successful check, in addition to counting as a success, grants a +2 bonus to Diplomacy checks related to the challenge. Success by 10 or more also reveals the dragon might accept a gift.
> 
> **Society (DC 22; 5 minutes; 1 success, maximum 1 success):** The character recalls some interesting historical tidbit of interest to the dragon. In addition to counting as a success, a successful check also removes 1 failure.
> 
> ### Secondary Skills
> **Intimidation (DC 29):** The dragon does not respond well to threats or bullying. On a Critical Success the dragon is impressed with the characters show of force, granting a +2 bonus to Diplomayc checkes related to the challenge.  Any other result makes the dragon angrier and is considered an automatic failure. 
> 
> ### Success
> Success: The dragon reveals useful information pertaining to the questions the characters put forward. This is an excellent place to see future quests, foreshadow upcoming adventures, or reveal a secret about the campaign. If Zestren is with the party and he is allowed to ask after Riddle, the dragon reveals Riddle is dead and that her soul is being held by a necromancer named Kyrznan in the dark city of Gloomwrought. Riddle cannot be restored to life until the soul is first recovered. If the characters succeed on the skill challenge without accumulating any failures, the dragon rewards the character with the highest Charisma score a boon. See Whispers from Beyond below.
> 
> ### Failure 
>  The dragon grows angry and attacks the heroes.
> 
> ### Special
> Offering the dragon a gift worth at least 100 gp grants 2 successes, with 1 additional success for each additional 50 gp of its worth.

> [!note]+ Whispers from Beyond
> You hear strange chaotic whispers and experience unsettling visions, yet from the confusing jumble can pick out useful insights.
> **Property:** You gain a +1 item bonus to initiative and Perception checks.
> **Power (Daily):** `pf2:r`  When an enemy enters a square adjacent to you it hears strange chaotic whispers. The target must succeed at a Will based on your class DC or become flat-footed to you and take a –2 penalty to attack rolls that include you as a target until the end of your next turn.

## Conclusion
The adventure ends when the characters rescue the prisoners from Magrak or, if the adventurers follow up on the oracle, after getting the information they or Zestren need (or slaying the dragon). If Cluff survives, he thanks the heroes for their help and assures them they will be treated like kings the next time they come through Cled. If the characters helped Zestren learn Riddle’s fate (see Tactical [[#Encounter 5: Eyes in the Dark]] for more information on her fate), the elf is grieved by the knowledge but is more resolved than ever to hunt down the necromancer and free Riddle’s soul. 

You also have the matter of the orc chieftain. Po is angry about not getting his slaves and a little snooping around should garner him the names of the characters. He might seek revenge by attacking the adventurers later or mount an attack on Restwell Keep. If, though, the adventurers failed to rescue the prisoners, they might try to locate them and wrest them from the orc. What did he want the slaves for? Where are they? Do they still live?

The bandits aided Magrak Ironjaw and now camp here, finding creative ways to spend their coin. They owe Magrak no particular loyalty and are open to discussion since they are not particularly interested in dying.

The captain, hunter, mage, and two bandits are at the site. The other eight bandits are off doing something bad in the trees. They come to investigate sounds of fighting at the start of the third round entering from the right side of the map.

Cluff's mercenaries will move to intercept these bandits as the emerge from the trees. 

As noted above, if the characters arrive before the orcs, allow the characters to see the camp and where the creatures are positioned. The characters can use [[skills#Stealth|Stealth]] against the sentries’ passive [[skills#Perception|Perception]] to move into position and possibly take the entire camp by surprise.

When the heroes can see the encampment, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> In the shadow cast by the wooden fort, you spy an encampment with a fire burning in the center. A little more than a half-dozen humanoids loiter, drink, and carouse. Each one wears a soiled bandage around his or her left arm—probably a badge of some kind.

If the heroes approach in the open, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A slim half-elf looks up from the mob and pins you with a suspicious glare. “Looks like you chose a bad day to stop by, right fellas?” Much laughter ensues.

### Tactics
The bandits fight simply, working in teams to flank while the mage hurls magic missiles and other spells into the party’s midst.

The mercenaries engage a separate group of bandits.  Two of them die in round two.  They are able to finish off the bandits by the end of round six.

### Botching the Encounter
If the characters wipe out the bandits and learn nothing from them, all is not lost. [[Millen Silvereye]], the psychic tiefling who runs the Trading Post, is relieved to be rid of the bandits and tells the characters everything they need to know in exchange for 10 gp. Substitute someone else if Millen is dead or gone.

### Features of the Area
> [!tip]+ Treasure
> In addition to the gear carried by the captain, hunter and mage, the bandits have 2 [[healing-potion|Healing Potion (Moderate)]] and a sack of 80 gp (payment from Magrak).

## Encounter 2: Dung and Feathers
- [x] Low (60 XP) Level 10

![[5A - The Slaver's Stone (D181)-20240816223027483.webp]]

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 2: [[harpy-warbird|Harpy Warbird]] H

```encounter
name: Dung and Feathers
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 2: [[Harpy Warbird]]
```


The harpies perch atop the monoliths.

When the heroes come upon the Stone Teeth, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Eight monoliths, each twenty feet tall, rise around the trail leading to the Scar. No stone stands straight; they lean as if they might fall at any moment. Lichen and dung stain the rocks, likely from the screeching bird women perched atop them. One calls out, “A gift and we shall let your band pass unharmed!” Just then, you hear a pitiful cry sounding from atop the eighth stone, where you see a terrified young woman searching for a way down.

### Tactics
The harpies start the fight by using Captivating Song against enemies and then swoop down from their perches to make attacks and then land on another monolith. They fight until only one remains, at which point it kills the prisoner and flys off toward the valley.

Standard harpies break off and attack the mercenaries.  Two of the mercenaries will die during round two of this engagement.  They will finish off the harpies during round three.

> [!danger]+ Trap
> ### Unstable Monolith (Single-Use Terrain)
> 
> The spotted stone does not sit easily in the earth and might fall with a bit of pressure.
> 
> **Requirement:** You must be adjacent to the monolith.
> **Check:** DC 24 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check to topple the monolith
> **Success:** The monolith falls and each creature in a close blast 3 away from the character makes a DC 25 reflex save.  Those who fail suffer `dice: 4d8+8` damage, the monolith knocks the target prone, and the target has cover and cannot stand. The target can use the [[escape|Escape]] (DC 24) to end the “cannot stand” condition. 
> **Failure:** Half damage, and the target moves to the nearest unoccupied square adjacent to the blast.

### Features of the Area
**Monolith:** Each monolith stands 20 feet tall and counts as blocking terrain. A monolith has 80 hit points. These stones have plenty of handholds and can be climbed with a DC 21 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check.  Furthermore, a good shove might knock a stone to the ground.
**Chained Prisoner (L):** Use Cled warrior statistics for the prisoner, whose name is Lysa. She attacks any harpy she can reach on initiative count 10.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> The harpies keep their wealth stashed atop one of the stones. It consists of 63 gp and 34 sp, [[enervation-apg|Spell Scroll - 4th Level (Enervation)]] and [[blood-booster-tv|Blood Booster (Moderate)]].

## Encounter 3: Chain Gang
- [x] Trivial (40 XP) Level 10

![[5A - The Slaver's Stone (D181)-20240816232439786.webp]]

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 1: [[magrak-ironjaw|Magrak Ironjaw]] M
 - 2: [[orc-raider|Orc Raider]] R
 - 2: [[hobgoblin-general|Hobgoblin General]] H

```encounter
name: Chain Gang
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 1: [[Magrak IronJaw]] 
- 2: [[Orc Raider]]
- 2: [[Hobgoblin General, Hobgoblin Sentry]]
```

Magrak has set up camp around the Slaver’s Stone. He sits around the campfire. The orc raider guard the dozen prisoners. The hobgoblins hold positions to watch for enemies, while a few archers hide in the rocks so they can pick off intruders from cover and the rest take positions atop the drum. Magrak expects the orc chieftain, but anyone else gets one warning to “sod off ” before he orders his force to attack.

When the heroes see the encampment, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A twenty-foot tall stone drum with a crude stair winding all around rises in the center of an encampment, where you see several humanoids and their prisoners milling about. 
> 
> [[skills#Perception|Perception]] DC 20: You spot a filthy human armed with a longbow hiding in the rocks.

### Tactics
Magrak doesn’t place much stock in group tactics and it shows in the forces under his command. Magrak prefers to fight with murderous intent. 

The orcs abandon their prisoners on the first round by using ferocious charge to close the distance and then focus attacks on their targets until they can use sudden charge. The archers and sentries fight simply. The sentries move to clump up into teams of two to benefit from their phalanx soldier auras while the archers pick off any ranged enemies they can see.

The mercenaries charge the archers recognizing them to be a big threat.  None of them will die in this engagement.

### Features of the Area
**Rocks:** The large rocks jutting from the ground count as difficult terrain and grant cover to creatures fully in their spaces. Prone creatures fully in these spaces gain superior cover.
**Slaver’s Stone:** A wide and 20-foottall stone platform occupies the camp’s center. The stairs winding around the platform are difficult terrain. A fall from the top deals `dice: 2d10` damage.
**Prisoners:** The twelve prisoners are in chains and immobilized. Freeing a prisoner requires a DC 25 [[skills#Thievery|Thievery]] or DC 29 Strength check. The chain can also be attacked: Hardness 8, 60 hp. The prisoners use Cled warrior statistics except their melee basic attacks deal half damage until they are armed.

### Cluff
If asked what's next, Cluff will ask for an escort out of the Chaos Scar and then take the survivors back to his clan.

If asked about [[Zestren]], Cluff will share a crazy conversation he had with Zestren about somethe he called "The Cloven Skull."  The PCs while not familiar with it directly have heard of the location.  Allow a [[skills#Society|Society]] check DC 26 to recall that the Cloven Skull is said to be a rocky formation against the face of the cliff not to far from where the PCs currently are.

## Encounter 4: Guardians of the Skull
- [ ] Trivial (95 XP) Level 10

![[5A - The Slaver's Stone (D181)-20240817000107777.webp]]

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 4: [[leng-ghoul|Leng Ghoul]] G
 - 1: [[titan-centipede|Titan Centipede]] S

```encounter
name: EncounterName
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 4: [[Leng Ghoul]] 
- 1: [[Titan Centipede], hidden]
- 2: [[Blade Mercenary, Mercernary C, Ally], 13]
- 2: [[Blade Mercenary, Mercernary D, Ally], 13]
- 2: [[Blade Mercenary, Mercernary E, Ally], 13]
```

Two ghouls along with their pet centipede established themselves here to exact payment from any who would treat with the oracle, a fee of which the oracle is unaware and never receives. The undead prefer living gifts for passage, and anyone who offers a sacrifice can move through the gap unmolested. Otherwise, they block anyone from entering, happily attacking those who try.

When the heroes reach the Cloven Skull, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A massive stone skull with a split down the middle juts from the side of a rocky wall. Humanoid skulls with bits of flesh still clinging to the bone stand in piles and hang in bundles from ropes on either side of the fissure.

If the heroes approach, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Two filthy humanoids dressed in befouled rags emerge from the gap, mouths spread wide in horrid smiles of jagged teeth and long black tongue. They spread their thin arms in welcome, showing stained hands ending in sharp talons. One says, “See the oracle? Pay price. One life and you may pass.”

### Tactics
The ghouls hold positions in front of the gap, using claw or bite attacks against immobilized and stunned opponents. The centipede rumbles from out of some rubble at the side of the room lost in the darkness at the start of the second round.

The mercenaries all join the players in this combat.  Adjust group C to have half health.

### Features of the Area
**Cloven Skull:** The gap in the skull leads into a dark and winding passage that eventually ends at a subterranean lake.
**Skull Stacks:** Humanoid skulls stand in neat stacks to either side of the gap. The stacks count as blocking terrain. All squares within 3 squares of each stack count as necrotic ground. Creatures that attempt to heal on necrotic ground regain only half the normal number of hit points.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> Scattered across the ground are 42 gp and a pouch of [[scour-gmg|Scour]].
> 
> - [ ] gp::42
> - [ ] consumable::[[scour-gmg|Scour]] [ilvl::8] [gp::80]

## Encounter 5: Eyes in the Dark
- [ ] Moderate (140 XP) Level 10

![[Pasted image 20240817120426.png]]

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 1: [[adult-silver-dragon|Adult Silver Dragon]] O
 - 6: [[chaos-spwaned-merloc|Chaos Spawn Murloc]] W

```encounter
name: EncounterName
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 1: [[Adult Silver Dragon, Lake Oracle]] 
- 6: [[Chaos Spawn Merloc]]
- 2: [[Blade Mercenary, Mercernary C, Ally], 13]
- 2: [[Blade Mercenary, Mercernary D, Ally], 13]
- 2: [[Blade Mercenary, Mercernary E, Ally], 13]
```

The Lake Oracle lurks on the island in the lake’s center. The Chaos Spawn Merlocs haunt the water and emerge to join the fight should the dragon come under attack.

When the heroes enter this cavern, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Beyond the ghouls, you find a cramped, winding passage burrowing deep into the mountain.  It ends at a stony shore against which oily black water laps. A rocky island dotted with purple chaos crystals rises from the waters some distance away, where you can just make out a humanoid figure crouching by the lake.

The heroes can catch the Lake Oracle’s attention by calling to her. She climbs on a small boat and rows to the opposite shore.

When the Oracle reaches the heroes, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A pale human woman with white, unseeing eyes regards you through dirty gray strands of hair. She wears nothing, but is unashamed by her nakedness. She says, “You have come seeking knowledge. Tell me why I should cast aside mystery’s veil.”

If combat breaks out, refer to the encounter.  However, if the heroes approach the Lake oracle with more discretion, they can instead try to persuade the dragon to reveal a secret, foretell an event, or provide some other bit of information the characters need to learn. If the characters take this approach, run the “Consulting the oracle” skill challenge below

> ### Failure 
> The dragon grows angry and attacks the heroes.

### Tactics
The dragon drops her disguise, uses frightful presence, and then uses her breath weapon. The dragon then moves away, flying near the ceiling or near the island until breath weapon recharges. She uses melee attacks against any creature that closes on her.

Her servants emerge from the waters to attack.

The surviving mercenaries will join this combat as well.  Adjust heath and remaining numbers appropriately.

### Features of the Area

**Ceiling:** The ceiling is 30 feet overhead.
**Water:** Water squares adjacent to the shore count as difficult terrain. Beyond these squares, a character must swim (DC 20 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check).
