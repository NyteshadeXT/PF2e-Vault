# Background
A few days ago, a wereboar slaver named Magrak Ironjaw attacked the remote village of Cled to capture prisoners he intended to sell as slaves. Magrak, his own troops, plus those of the Proud Boys bandits, led the prisoners across the King’s Wall and into the scar, bound for the Slaver’s Stone not far from the valley mouth. There, he hopes to offload the chattel to an orc chieftain who is known to be a good customer for slavers. 

Hot on the wereboar’s heels, however, is Cluff Maclire, chief and warleader at Cled. He nearly caught the slaver, but lost Magrak’s trail at the King’s Wall. Cluff then traveled to Restwell Keep, where he hopes to round up support from Lord Drysdale to rescue his people.

## Adventure Synopsis
The adventure begins at Restwell Keep. There, the characters run across Cluff, who asks them for help after being rebuffed by the bailiff, who wants no trouble with the notorious slaver. Cluff, with his own warriors, the characters, and a guide named Zestren, heads into the Chaos Scar to pick up the bandits’ trail. The expedition winds up at the Crossroads where the Proud Boys, who parted ways with the wereboar, are camped. From them, the characters learn where Magrak was headed.

The adventurers can then move to intercept the slaver band. They nearly catch up with them at the Stone Forest, a blighted area of petrified trees, but are delayed by several harpies. Magrak, it appears, offered the harpies a sacrifice—a young woman—to gain safe passage through their territory. If the characters rescue her, they can learn important information about how to defeat the wereboar before he gets to the Slaver’s Stone. That night, however, Zestren makes off with the captive and hauls her to the oracle at Cloven Skull. Cluff, dismayed, must choose to either follow the traitor or to push on to rescue the greater number of his folk.

# Running the Adventure

## The Consequences of Time
Cautious adventurers might take one or more rests during the adventure. This is bad news for the poor prisoners, because the villains aren’t going to put their plans on hold for 8 hours. Luckily, extended resting shouldn’t be necessary thanks to the Companions (see below). Still, the adventurers might take their time, and if they do, they face specific consequences.

**First Rest:** Cluff and the minions abandon the party unless the characters can persuade them otherwise. You should run this as a complexity 1 skill challenge involving DC 17 [[skills#diplomacy|Diplomacy]] or [[skills#Intimidation|Indimidation]] checks. Success means Cluff sticks around. Failure means he doesn’t, resorting to combat if he must.

**Second Rest:** The captive at the Stone Forest is eaten. Add 1 orc chieftain (Monster Manual, page 204) and 8 orc warriors (Monster Manual, page 203) to Tactical Encounter 3: Chain Gang.

**Third Rest:** Magrak sells all the prisoners at the Slaver’s Stone and is gone by the time the adventurers reach the place. The characters have failed. They might rescue the prisoners from the orc chieftain, though how this might play out is up to you.

## Zestren
Zestren joins Cluff Maclire’s expedition at Restwell Keep. He claims to know the land around the Scar well. Zestren has an ulterior motive in joining the group, however—he intends on betraying them.

The eladrin is desperate to learn the fate of Riddle, his lover who was lost during another adventure long ago. Riddle was swallowed up in a dark portal beneath a ruined keep. Zestren has spent his time trying to recover his lover with little luck. His efforts eventually put him on the path to the Lake Oracle who lived just outside the Scar in a cave known as the Cloven Skull. Zestren convinced himself the oracle was the only path to Riddle and thus sought her out.

When he reached the site, he was barred passage to her by a pair of wicked ghouls who demanded a living sacrifice before they would allow him passage. Zestren withdrew and stewed on their demand the long weeks since. The more he thought on it, the more convinced he became that it was the only way. When he heard of Cluff ’s predicament, he was certain it would give him the means to acquire a suitable sacrifice while still doing some good.

Zestren plans to abduct a rescued prisoner at some point during the journey and bring the captive to the ghouls as a sacrifice. Zestren is not completely committed to the plan and has not yet worked out how it will happen, so he is not beyond saving. If the opportunity presents itself, however, Zestren will take it and complete his slide into evil.

### Minor Quest : Stop Zestren’s Treachery
Unless stopped, Zestren steals a captive and makes off for the Cloven Skull to learn what secrets he can from the oracle. The adventurers can foil this plot by uncovering his true motives or stopping him from escaping with a prisoner.

**Quest XP:** 20 for each member of the group.

## Companions
Two companion characters, Cluff and Zestren, plus ten minions join the characters’ adventuring group. Divide the minions between the players but consider controlling the two companion characters yourself. If you have too much to handle already, you can assign these characters to the players, but be sure to keep Zestren’s motives secret. A handout at the end of this adventure contains all the statistics for these characters. If Zestren becomes an enemy, use his statistics as given on page 11.

### Cluff Maclire
![[Cluff Maclire.webp|400]]
[[Cluff Maclire.webp|Show to Players]]

Cluff Maclire is a middle-aged, lanky, pale human warrior with stringy brown hair going to gray. He wears a tartan kilt and a leather jack studded with metal spikes. He carries a bastard sword in a sheath hanging down the middle of his back. He is a plain-spoken man with little patience for nonsense and no tolerance for cowardice. He has vowed to kill Magrak Ironjaw and save his people even if it costs his own life.

Cluff is a loudmouth and braggart, he talks big but no one around here has ever heard of him before. The Maclire clansmen are fringe-dwellers, having little to do with civilized folks. 

### Zestren
![[Zestran.webp|400]]
[[Zestran.webp|Show to Players]]

Zestren is a graceful elven warrior dressed in traveler’s clothing and chainmail covered by a long, blue-gray cloak. He carries a longsword in a scabbard hanging from his leather belt. He says little and appears to disdain humans.

Zestren is new to the keep, having been around only for a few days. He keeps to himself and says little to anyone. He perks up when anyone mentions Magrak Ironjaw, however.. Some say he’s the only survivor of an adventuring group that met their match in a dungeon near Winterspring.

> [!tip]+ Skill Challenge
> # Something about Zestren
> The characters have several opportunities to talk with Zestren before his betrayal. Learning more about him and winning his friendship can reveal what he intends. This skill challenge takes place over several hours and can be run during short rests or through roleplaying while the party travels.
> 
> **Level:** 7 (20 xp)
> **Complexity:** 1 (requires 4 successes before 3 failures)
> **Primary Skills:**  [[skills#Arcana|Arcana]], [[skills#Deception|Deception]], [[skills#diplomacy|Diplomacy]], [[sense-motive|Perception: Sense Motive]] 
> **Secondary Skills:** [[skills#Arcana|Arcana]]
> 
> ## Primary Skills
> **Arcana (DC 27; 1 success, 1 successes max):** The character identifies Zestren as a magus and recalls something useful about magus training, which can provide the character with a topic to discuss with Zestren (and allow for further bonding). Magus gain a +5 bonus to this check.
> 
> **Deception (DC 25; 1 success, 2 successes max):** A character uses false pretenses to learn more about Zestren. The first success reveals that he was an adventurer whose party met a terrible end beneath a ruined keep. A second success softens him up and he reveals a bit about Riddle, his lost love, though he keeps secret his efforts to recover her. A failed Deception check results in two failures, closes off the Deception skill for the duration of the challenge, and increases all other DCs by 2.
> 
> **Diplomacy (DC 25; 1 success, 4 successes max):** A character tries to befriend Zestren. The first two successful checks reveal the same information as described under Deception. The third check reveals a general dislike for humans over the fact that a human was responsible for Riddle’s apparent demise. A third or fourth success by the same character establishes a strong connection so that Zestren does not attack that character unless he is first attacked.
> 
> **Perception: Sense Motive (DC 17; 1 success, 2 successes max):** The character senses that Zestren is uneasy, and the uneasiness grows as the party travels into the Chaos Scar. A critical success grants an extra success and also identifies that Zestren is grieving. A character gains a bonus to Diplomacy checks made during this challenge equal to the number of successes earned from Sense Motive checks.
> 
> ## Secondary Skills
> **Arcana (DC 27; 1 success, 1 successes max):** The character identifies Zestren as a magus and recalls something useful about magus training, which can provide the character with a topic to discuss with Zestren (and allow for further bonding). Magus gain a +5 bonus to this check.
> 
> ## Success
> The character or characters gain Zestren’s trust and he divulges his whole sorry tale, including his terrible plan. He accepts any solution the characters put forward—killing the ghouls, offering a villain as a sacrifice, or something else.
> 
> ## Failure 
> Zestren goes through with the plan. Also, add 1 cackling harpy to Tactical Encounter 2: Stone Forest.

The adventure begins in Restwell Keep. The party can be at the Keep for a variety of reasons, such as picking up supplies, gathering information about another lead, or simply taking some well-deserved downtime between expeditions. Once the adventurers conduct all their business, introduce them to Cluff Maclire. Cluff is at the following locations at the indicated times.

- **Main Gate (late morning):** Cluff and his warriors enter the community to speak with the bailiff. 
- **Bailiff’s Tower (late morning):** The bailiff, who wants nothing to do with Magrak Ironjaw, informs Cluff that he intends to send out a force to deal with the slaver and then never does.
- **Fountain Square (midday):** Cluff makes a scene by haranguing locals about Magrak Ironjaw and what he did to Cluff ’s folk—namely how the brute stole their women and burned down their huts. After a few minutes of this, [[Kendon Longstrider]] and a handful of guards come in and break up the assembly to scattered applause. Cluff storms away to drink off his rage at the Stumbling Giant.
- **The Stumbling Giant (afternoon until morning):** Cluff and company knock back grog at the Giant. As the hours wear on, their sobriety diminishes until the entire band passes out sometime after midnight.

### Talking with Cluff
The characters should run across Cluff in the Keep. Make it clear that he’s an unhappy man on a mission. Characters who approach him should learn the following bits of information.

- Cluff Maclire is the chief of Clan Maclire, a proud warrior tribe with a settlement several leagues to the north “as the crow flies.”
- A few days back while Cluff and the warriors were orc-hunting, a coward named Magrak Ironjaw raided the settlement, “burning all our homes and stealing the women who chose to stay behind.” He knows it was Magrak because “the women gave as good as they got and the coward left his dead and dying behind for our questioning.”
- Cluff is sure he can find the slaver at the Crossroads. He intends to head there first thing in the morning and “give that brigand the killing he’s earned.”

Any interest expressed by the characters about Cluff ’s predicament results in the chieftain pushing hard to recruit the adventurers to help him. At first, he runs with the honor bit—“An honorable warrior could see the righteousness of our cause.” If that fails, he resorts to guilt—“You wouldn’t doom innocents to an unspeakable fate, would you?” Finally, he settles for insults—“Well, I can see you lack the stones to go with real warriors. When we get back, I’ll teach you the basics of how to handle a spear.” If none of those efforts works, Cluff and Zestren leave with their small group of warriors but without the characters.

Three days later, one of those warriors returns to describe how the expedition ended in ruin. Led by their guide Zestren, a few of the best hunters sneaked into the slavers’ camp at night and freed just one person, a young woman. Cluff hoped that she could provide information that would help the warriors defeat the slavers and release all the captives. Before the warriors could strike in force, harpies ambushed them at the Stone Forest. During that fight, Zestren and the rescued woman ran off, leaving everyone else to their fate.

As word of this spreads, Lord Drysdale raises the bounty for Magrak Ironjaw’s head to 110 gp and also offers 50 gp for Zestren’s head.

### Magrak Ironjaw
Magrak Ironjaw is a warrior, slaver, and bandit. Because of his depredations, Lord Drysdale has offered a 110 gp bounty for Ironjaw’s head. Few people have tried to hunt him down, and those who have never return. Magrak is a wereboar. He runs with a mixed band of orcs, half-orcs, and other scum. Because he provides a needed commodity (slaves), he comes and goes as he pleases in the Chaos Scar.

## On the Way
Reaching the Crossroads involves following the old trail toward the Chaos Scar. The characters might encounter a few locals along the way. Consider injecting one or two of the following encounters during the trek to the Crossroads.

### Escaped Prisoner
One of Magrak’s prisoners, a handsome young woman from Cled, escaped the wereboar. Unfortunately, Magrak dispatched his warriors to chase her down. Once the characters defeat the pursuers, then find the woman, Allysen can tell the adventurers that Magrak is headed for some place called the Slaver’s Stone, though she doesn’t know where that is. Cluff, if with the party, sends two warriors to escort her back to their lands.

- 4 [[orc-raider|Orc Raider]] 

```encounter
name: Escaped Prisoner
party: Chaos Scar

### Howling Pack
A gnoll band spills across the countryside to attack the adventurers. They are undeterred by the characters’ greater numbers. The gnolls’ erratic behavior comes from the meal they made on strange mushrooms found in a nearby glade.

- 4 [[gnoll-warfang|Gnoll Warfang]]

## Roaming Dead
A reckless necromancer was killed when he tried to raise an undead army. The results of his foolish ritual now roam the Chaos Scar.

```

## 1.  Crossroads
The Crossroads are beyond the King’s Wall, about halfway to the Chaos Scar, at the juncture of the main trail and a second, smaller trail that leads to the north. 

When the characters approach the Crossroads, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The muddy path leads to a road junction where you see a wooden fort and a couple of buildings. A large, metal construction stands to one side, and from it hang iron cages. Ravens clot the cages, gorging themselves on the contents.

The Proud Boys gang camps near the trading post. They are cruel brigands who sometimes work with Magrak when he needs more muscle than his own team can provide. The bandits accompanied Magrak on his last expedition but split off from him to spend their pay at the trading post.

The characters can beat the information they need from the brigands and, in fact, this might be the best approach. In that case, go to [[#Encounter 1 Local Color]].

Alternatively, cautious adventurers might try talking (or, they might beat the needed information from a captive after defeating the bandits). In that case, run the “Interrogating the Brigands” skill challenge. If parley occurs first, the bandit captain, a wily half-elf named Carrus, does the talking. Carrus is unpleasant, has a foul mouth, and a leering eye. Otherwise, the same information can come from any of the bandits. Characters gain a +2 bonus to Intimidate checks if they defeat the bandits first.

> [!tip]+ Skill Challenge
> # Interrogating the Brigands

> **Level:** 5 (20 xp)
> **Complexity:** 1 (requires 4 successes before 3 failures)
> **Primary Skills:**  [[skills#deception|Deception]], [[skills#society|Society]] ,[[sense-motive|Perception: Sense Motive]], [[skills#Intimidation|Indimidation]], Special (see below)
> **Secondary Skills:** None
> 
> ### Primary Skills
> **Deception (DC 27, One Minute, 1 success, 2 successes maximum):** A character uses deception to winkle out the truth. The first success reveals the bandits are called the Proud Boys and that they “ain’t afraid o’ no ’venturers.” A second success gets them to admit they know Magrak Ironjaw, “jes saw ’im the day a’fore.” A critical success results in an extra success. A failed check nets a failure and closes off Deception to future use.
> 
> **Society (DC 27, One Minute, 1 success, 1 success maximum):** A character recalls some exploit attributed to the Proud Boys. A successful check reveals the Boys are a gang who sometimes join forces with more powerful groups. A critical success lets the character remember the Boys once double-crossed an ogre named Blath and it’s said he still has an axe to grind against them. This information grants the character a +2 bonus to Deception and Intimidate checks for the duration of the challenge.
> 
> **Sense Motive (DC 24, One Minute, 1 success, 1 success maximum):** The character reads the bandits. A successful check reveals they are intimidated by numbers and might respond to violence.
> 
> **Intimidation (DC 27, One Minute, 1 success, 2 successes maximum):** The character uses threats to start them talking with the same results as described under Deception.
>
> **Special:** A character that kills a Proud Boy bandit gets their attention and earns the heroes 1 success. Killing a second bandit earns 1 failure and ends the skill challenge in failure if it happens before the combat.
> 
> ### Success
> The captain (or prisoner) reveals that they had hooked up with Magrak and helped raid a settlement beyond the wall. Magrak paid them and left them here. They think Magrak is headed to the Slaver’s Stone, “just beyond the Stone Forest.” They can provide directions. After the heroes depart, the bandits track them and attack the first time the heroes camp to rest.
> 
> ### Failure 
> If the failure comes before combat, the bandits attack. If it comes after, the adventurers learn the same information as above, but the bandits follow them and attack while the heroes are engaged against the harpies in Tactical Encounter 2: Dung and Feathers.

## Encounter 1: Local Color

![[5A - The Slaver's Stone (D181)-20240809215828479.webp]]

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 2: [[BadGuy1]] W
 - 2: [[BadGuy2]] H

```encounter
name: EncounterName
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 2: [[Badguy1]] 
- 2: [[Badguy2]]
```

1 half-elf bandit captain (C)
1 half-orc hunter (H)
1 human renegade mage (M)
8 Proud Boy bandits (P)

The bandits aided Magrak Ironjaw and now camp here, finding creative ways to spend their coin. They owe Magrak no particular loyalty and are open to discussion since they are not particularly interested in dying.

The captain, hunter, mage, and four bandits are at the site. The other four bandits are off doing something bad in the trees. They come to investigate sounds of fighting at the start of the third round entering from the right side of the map.

As noted above, if the characters arrive before the orcs, allow the characters to see the camp and where the creatures are positioned. The characters can use Stealth against the sentries’ passive Perception to move into position and possibly take the entire camp by surprise.

When the heroes can see the encampment, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> In the shadow cast by the wooden fort, you spy an encampment with a fire burning in the center. A little more than a half-dozen humanoids loiter, drink, and carouse. Each one wears a soiled bandage around his or her left arm—probably a badge of some kind.

If the heroes approach in the open, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A slim half-elf looks up from the mob and pins you with a suspicious glare. “Looks like you chose a bad day to stop by, right fellas?” Much laughter ensues.

Tactics
The bandits fight simply, working in teams to flank
while the mage hurls magic missiles and other spells
into the party’s midst.

Botching the Encounter
If the characters wipe out the bandits and learn nothing
from them, all is not lost. Millen Silvereye, the
psychic tiefling who runs the Trading Post, is relieved
to be rid of the bandits and tells the characters
everything they need to know in exchange for 50 gp.
Substitute someone else if Millen is dead or gone.

Features of the Area
Treasure: The captain has a level 6 magic item.
The bandits have 2 potions of healing and a sack of 350
gp (payment from Magrak).
