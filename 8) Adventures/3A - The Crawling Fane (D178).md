# Background
Hargash Bitterblade is a rather eccentric duergar. He has forsaken the worship of the proper duergar gods and instead worships a bizarre entity he calls Chitteruk, which claims dominion over vermin and all things that creep and crawl. Years ago, Hargash fled a large duergar city to escape certain death for his heresy and devotion to his alien god. He and a few of his more fervent followers traveled many years through the Underdark until, finally, the entity that Hargash serves sent him a dream. The dream provided the location of a long-forgotten temple dedicated to the dwarven god Moradin. Hargash was commanded to re-sanctify the temple in the name of Chitteruk. 

Although Hargash’s vision was sent by an evil entity, it did not come from Chitteruk—because no such creature actually exists. The dream was sent by the great meteorite in the Chaos Scar, which has deluded Hargash and his followers into its service. The temple to Moradin is within the Chaos Scar. In the last few months, Hargash and his small band of followers have moved into the temple. They have been slowly remaking the temple into a place suitable for the worship of Chitteruk. For his endeavors, Hargash has been gifted with uncanny power over verminous monsters. This power comes from the meteorite and not from Hargash’s imaginary god, but it is real power nonetheless. Hargash has filled his new home with all manner of creeping, crawling monstrosities. This includes a small group of ettercaps, also drawn to the area by the meteorite. 

Recently, Hargash has been receiving waking visions from the meteorite in the guise of Chitteruk. In these visions, Chitteruk shows Hargash a band of heroes, a meddling group of do-gooders who intend to thwart Chitteruk’s plans for the fane. Through Chitteruk, the meteorite commands Hargash to destroy these heroes and remove their influence from the area. It just so happens that the heroes are currently in the Chaos Scar; in fact, they are right above Hargash’s head...

# Running the Adventure
**Total Adventure Value:** 315 xp

**The Hammer of Ivak Stoneblood ([[Restwell Jobs#Word of Mouth|Word of Mouth]]):** [[Gorn Hammerfall]], a devout follower of Moradin, is searching for a lost relic sacred to his faith. The relic, the Hammer of Ivak, was lost when the temple of Moradin in the Chaos Scar was destroyed. Torak believes he knows the location of the lost temple of Moradin and asks the heroes to seek it out and recover the Hammer of Ivak. To aid the characters in their endeavor, Torak offers up his own magical hammer, a +1 thundering warhammer to any hero who can wield it. 

Big Bugs ([[Restwell Jobs#Word of Mouth|Word of Mouth]]): Giant, venomous insects and other monstrous vermin have attacked and poisoned people near the King’s Wall. The PCs are approached by the druid Lofinor who asks the them to obtain the venom sacks from five venomous giant bugs (centipedes, scorpions, or spiders) so she can produce an antivenom. She offers 5 gp for each venom sack obtained and promises the adventurers two doses of [[antivenom-potion-tio|Antivenom Potion]] if they bring back at least five venom sacks. A venom sack can be recovered from a slain bug with a DC 12 [[skills#nature|Nature]] check. 

# We Aren’t Going to Take It!
The characters witness bug attacks against innocent people and decide to do something about it instead of waiting for someone to ask. Or, they themselves could come under attack by giant bugs on their way into or out of the Scar and rightly conclude that the bugs represent a larger problem... or that their lair probably contains treasure. 

In the last two cases, finding the temple is relatively easy. The characters need only watch for the bugs and follow them back to their nest.

# Encounter 1 - Temple Ruins
Read or paraphrase the following when the characters reach the above-ground temple ruins: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Before you, the crumbling shape of a long-abandoned ruin juts from the wild landscape of the Chaos Scar. The ruin stands open to the sky, and its once sturdy walls are now little more than weed-choked rubble. Two towering statues, each so weathered and eroded that its features are impossible to make out, flank what was once the main entrance. It is hard to imagine this sad, forgotten structure was once sacred to the faith of Moradin.

**Encounter Difficulty:** Low (75 xp)

```encounter

- 3: [[Web Lurker]]
```

Thanks to his many insect spies, Hargash is aware whenever intruders approach the temple ruins. As soon as the heroes enter the ruins, Hargash completes a powerful ritual that shakes and cracks the earth. The ritual opens a chasm in the ground that connects with the subterranean sections of the ruined temple. From this chasm climb web lurkers and poisonous centipedes, servants of Hargash and his god Chitteruk. When Hargash completes his ritual, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The air is suddenly filled with the grating rumble of rock. The earth splits into a gaping chasm not far from where you stand. The ground beneath your feet bucks like some colossal, angry beast, and you must struggle to keep your balance. 

Each character must make a Reflex save (DC 11) to avoid being knocked prone. The shaking stops on the following round, and moments later, web lurkers and centipedes swarm out of the chasm created by the ritual to attack the adventurers. 

## Tactics
In the first round of combat, the web lurkers and centipedes focus their attacks on characters who were knocked prone by the earthquake. As battle continues, the centipede swarms gang up on a single hero to increase the damage output of their swarm aura. The web lurkers use web to immobilize characters and increase the damage from their melee attacks. In the first rounds of combat, the web lurkers try to flank adventurers in order to use their spider bite attack, switching to their claws after a successful bite.

## Developments
When the adventurers approach the crevasse, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The ground has split open, revealing a deep chasm that descends into darkness. A faint glimmer of light is visible at the bottom, but it is impossible to gauge the distance from the light to where you stand at the top of the rift. The walls of the chasm are jagged with protruding stones and the gnarled roots of trees; certainly enough handholds to make for a fairly easy climb. 

The chasm drops 30 feet to the floor of the temple ruins below. It is fairly easy to climb, requiring only a DC 12 [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] check; there is, however, a 10-foot drop from the rectory’s ceiling to the floor, so heroes with no training in Acrobatics need to lower a rope or take `dice: 1d10` damage from the fall. 

## Features of the Area 
**Illumination:** Daylight

**Chasm:** The chasm plunges 30 feet down to the floor of the rectory. The walls can be climbed with a DC 12 [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] check. 

**Rubble:** The rubble in this area is difficult terrain. 

**Statues:** The statues are blocking terrain and provide cover to adjacent creatures. 

**Walls:** The walls range from 5 to 8 feet in height. They can be climbed with a DC 12 [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] check. The tops of the walls are narrow and crumbling; characters moving atop the walls must succeed at a DC 12 [[skills#acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check; the character falls prone atop the wall with a result of 6-9, or falls to the ground with a result of 5 or less.

# Encounter 2 - Ancient Rectory

> [!danger]+ Trap
> [[camouflaged-spiked-pit|Camouflaged Spiked Pit]]

The two piles of rubble mark where the characters land if they drop straight down from the chasm opening. They might be concerned about landing in the loose stone, but it presents no danger (it is difficult terrain). The danger here comes from the web lurkers and duergar waiting to attack. When the first character reaches the bottom of the chasm (but hasn’t yet dropped into the room), read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The chasm ends in the ceiling of a large, brightly lit room. Directly beneath you is a pile of stones and debris that must have tumbled down when the chasm opened. 

When the first character drops into the room, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The room appears to be an ancient rectory filled with decrepit furniture, including rickety tables and chairs and a trio of beds covered with rotting blankets. A moth-eaten rug lies in the middle of the floor. Two braziers at the northern end of the room are lit and provide ample illumination. Between them stand four monstrous humanoids; two are the same as the insect-like horrors you fought above, and the other two resemble fiendish dwarves with bristly beards and glowing red eyes. That’s all you see before one of the dwarves kicks over a brazier and they all attack! 

## Tactics 
The duergar and web lurkers aren’t going to hold back until all the characters have gathered in the room. Ask for initiative rolls as soon as the first character drops in. Then the fight begins with the two duergar scouts acting immediately (they had prepared actions). The duergar on the eastern side of the room kicks over the brazier (a standard action), dousing it. The other duergar launches a crossbow bolt at the lone character in the room. Follow the normal initiative order from there. The other characters need to get down the chasm as quickly as possible. 

With half the room in shadow, the duergar scouts both use underdark sneak whenever possible. The web lurkers do not charge into battle immediately; instead they try to draw the heroes across the room and into the spiked pit trap beneath the rug. If the adventurers discover the pit trap or seem disinclined to engage the web lurkers in melee, then the web lurkers charge into melee. They rely on their claws until the invisible duergar join the fight, at which time they maneuver to gain combat advantage on a character in order to use spider bite. If a character ventures near the edge of the trap, a web lurker will try to bull rush him into the pit. 

The duergar prefer to snipe at heroes with their crossbows while invisible and save their infernal quills to hamper the attacks of enemies with powerful melee attacks. The scouts use underdark sneak as often as they are able, sticking to the shadows and staying close to a table or a bed. If forced into melee, the duergar switch to their warhammers and double-team injured characters. 

## Development 
A web lurker is stationed in the hallway beyond the ironbound doors (see tactical encounter [[04) The Hall of Honored Dead]] for details). It is reasonably alert (Perception +9) but not especially inquisitive. Make a [[skills#perception|Perception]] check (DC 22) for this web lurker at the start of each combat round, beginning with round 2. If the check succeeds three times, the web lurker finally grows curious and comes to investigate the noises from this room, which draws the creatures from area 04 into this fight. 

Once the fight ends, characters can examine the room. 

The short hallway leading to the ironbound doors is flanked by a pair of altars. Even a rudimentary examination shows that they were once dedicated to Moradin but have been grotesquely defaced. Moradin’s noble features have been replaced with a repulsive, insectoid visage that includes antennae and sharp mandibles. Extra, multi-jointed limbs have been crudely grafted to the deity’s torso. Because Chitteruk exists only in the mind of Hargash, Religion checks made to determine the identity of the insectoid deity reveal no information. 

The ironbound doors are thick and heavy but unlocked.

## Features of the Area 
**Illumination:** Bright within 5 squares of the western brazier (which burns as a torch); dim everywhere else, from light filtering down through the chasm. Dim illumination provides concealment against characters and creatures that don’t have low-light vision, darkvision, or some other sense. 

**Ceiling:** The ceiling is 10 feet high. 

**Beds, Tables, and Chairs:** The furniture is difficult terrain and provides cover. If a creature of Medium size or larger jumps onto a bed, table, or chair, it collapses and the creature must make an immediate [[skills#acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check (DC 12) to avoid falling prone. 

**Braziers:** The eastern brazier is dumped over and extinguished at the beginning of the encounter. If the remaining brazier is toppled (standard action), then the whole room is left in dim illumination. 

**Doors:** The ironbound doors at the northern end of the room are not locked. 

**Footlockers:** The ancient footlockers are still in good shape and their locks are sturdy. They can be opened with a DC 17 [[skills#thievery|Thievery]] check. One of the footlockers contains the treasure for this area. 

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> Found in the footlocker is 34 gp, [[architects-pattern-book-tv|Architect's Pattern Book]] and [[undead-scourge-lokl|Undead Scourge]].

**Rubble:** The rubble is difficult terrain.

# Encounter 3 - The Hall of Honored Dead
![[Pasted image 20230726090249.png]]

**Encounter Difficulty:** Low (60 xp)
Creatures:
 - 2: [[ogre-spider|Ogre Spider]] S
 - 1: [[web-lurker|Web Lurker]] E
 - 3: [[skin-beetle|Skin Beetle]] B

```encounter
name: The Hall of Honored Dead
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 2: [[Ogre Spider]] 
- 1: [[Web Lurker]]
- 3: [[Skin Beetle]]
```

If the web lurker didn’t respond to the battle in [[03) Ancient Rectory]], it is not expecting trouble now. Opening the ancient doors to this room makes an awful, screeching racket, however, so the adventurers can’t surprise the ettercap. 

The web lurker and three skin beetles in the northern end of the room are making no effort to hide. The ogre spiders are clinging to the ceiling, one above each of the large statues. As a result, there is a good chance they go unnoticed and surprise against the characters when battle begins. 

When the characters enter this room, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A large pool on a stone dais sits in the center of this room. Soft blue light spilling out of the pool fills the room with a dim radiance. The first things you see in that dim light are four sarcophagi arranged in a square around the pool. Three have been smashed open, but the fourth appears intact. Before you can take in anything else, movement at the far end of the room catches your eye, and you spot another of the insectlike humanoids. This one is surrounded by a small beetles. 

## Tactics 
When combat begins, the ogre spiders use drop from above, gaining surprise against players who didn't see them for this attack. The skin beetles move forward and attack the characters. The web lurker delays its action until the skin beetles have attacked. It then moves up, making sure to move adjacent to one of the beetles, and uses web net on the nearest adventurer. 

As the battle continues, the ogre spiders attack characters with their bite attacks until bloodied, at which time they climb back up and cling to the ceiling. From the ceiling, they reenter the fray with another attack from above. The skin beetles attack the characters in melee with bite attacks. The web lurker attacks the heroes in melee with venom goad and spider bite. It remains adjacent to a skin beetle or ogre spider so it can use verminous urging when the power recharges. 

## Development 
When the adventurers take the time to explore this room, describe its features fully. 

The pool is a type of scrying device. It only shows images of the lives of the dwarven heroes interred here. A character making a DC 15 [[skills#Arcana|Arcana]] or [[skills#Religion|Religion]] check while studying the pool can learn how to activate its magic. All that’s required is dipping a finger into the pool and speaking aloud the name of one of the dwarves buried here. The names of the heroes laid to rest in this room were inscribed on their sarcophagus lids, but sadly, three of them were destroyed by Hargash and his minions. Only one remains.

Any character who speaks dwarven can read the name “Ivak Stoneblood” inscribed into the lid of the intact sarcophagus. If Ivak’s name is used to activate the pool, it shows the following scenes: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A dwarven warrior in battered, scarred armor battles a group of duergar in the lightless reaches of the Underdark. He wields a mighty hammer with devastating skill. Each time its anvil-shaped head strikes a foe, it releases a flash of brilliant blue light and the duergar falls dead. 
> 
> The image fades and is replaced with a somber scene of dwarven priests interring the hammer-wielding warrior in a carved stone sarcophagus. The warrior is laid to rest with great reverence, and his hammer is laid across his chest before the lid of the sarcophagus is sealed in place. 

The crypt seen in the pool is obviously the same room where the characters stand. 

A DC 15 [[skills#Society|Society]] check reveals a little more about Ivak Stoneblood. He was famous for battling the duergar, and his hammer was reputed to be blessed by Moradin himself. 

If the heroes decide to open Ivak’s sarcophagus, it is not as easy as simply tipping off the lid. After keeping Hargash from violating the dwarven hero’s tomb, Moradin is not about to let a group of untested adventurers claim the hammer, whatever their intentions. If they wish to open the sarcophagus, characters must prove their worth to Moradin in some fashion. Until they do so, the sarcophagus can’t be opened; the power of Moradin prevents it. 

Happily, a DC 15 [[skills#Religion|Religion]] reveals at least two ways the adventurers can prove their good intentions. 
	✦ The characters can rededicate one of the altars in the rectory to Moradin. This requires one use of the holy water found in the two fonts in this room and a complexity 1 skill challenge ([[skills#Religion|Religion]] only, DC 13, 4 successes before 3 failures). 
	✦ The characters can restore one of the statues in the Hall of Honored Dead to its former condition. This requires a complexity 1 skill challenge ([[skills#Crafting|Crafting]] only, DC 13, 4 successes before 3 failures). 

If the heroes complete either or both of the skill challenges, they can then open the sarcophagus of Ivak Stoneblood. When the characters open the sarcophagus of Ivak Stoneblood, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The heavy lid of the sarcophagus slides away with a gentle push, revealing the body of a dwarven warrior dressed in crumbling, rust-pitted chainmail. Despite the decrepit state of the corpse’s armor and clothing, the stout warhammer lying across its skeletal chest looks as new as the day it was forged. 

The hammer’s head is shaped like an anvil and the steel gleams with a bluish tint. The Hammer of Ivak Stoneblood is a +1 [[striking|Striking]] [[devilblind|Devilblind]] warhammer.

## Features of the Area 
**Illumination:** The pool provides dim illumination to the entire room. 

**Ceiling:** The ceiling is 20 feet high. 

**Holy Water Fonts:** Two holy water fonts are mounted on short stone pillars in the northeast and northwest corners of the room. The power of Moradin is still strong enough in this area to prevent Hargash from turning the holy water into unholy water. A DC 15 [[skills#Arcana|Arcana]] or [[skills#Religion|Religion]] check when examining the fonts reveals that each contains a single use of holy water. This holy water has the unique property that it is effective against duergar; it inflicts damage on the tainted dwarves as if they were demons or undead. 

**Pool:** The dais the pool is mounted on is 4 feet high. It and the pool provide cover. The water in the pool is normal; the glow comes from the pool itself, which is enchanted in a manner similar to the Dark Light ritual. 

**Sarcophagi:** The smashed sarcophagi are difficult terrain. The intact sarcophagus is 4 feet high. All provide cover. A character can jump on top of the intact sarcophagus with a DC 15 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check. The three opened sarcophagi contain yellowed bones and tattered vestments in disarray. The fourth, unopened sarcophagus has the carved image of a resplendent dwarf warrior on its lid. 

**Statues:** The statues are blocking terrain and provide cover to adjacent creatures. Each is 10 feet tall. They once depicted dwarf warriors, but they have been remade to resemble great insectlike humanoids, with mandibles, multifaceted eyes, and many multi-jointed limbs.

# Encounter 4 - The Profaned Chapel
![[Pasted image 20230726110633.png]]

**Encounter Difficulty:** Severe (120 xp)
Creatures:
 - 1: [[ogre-spider|Ogre Spider]] D
 - 2: [[giant-scorpion|Giant Scorpion]] S
 - 1: [[duergar-shocktrooper|Duergar Shocktrooper]] T

```encounter
name: The Profaned Chapel
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 1: [[Ogre Spider]] 
- 2: [[Giant Scorpion]]
- 1: [[Duergar Shocktrooper]]
- 1: Hargash Bitterblade, 126, 19, 11
```

![[Pasted image 20230726115905.png]]

Hargash’s loud, monotonous chanting makes it difficult for his minions to hear the approach of intruders, and Hargash himself is completely tuned out of his surroundings. If the characters are careful, they can enter the chapel unnoticed and gain a surprise round. If they try to enter with [[skills#Stealth|Stealth]], the shock trooper and vermin suffer a -5 penalty to their passive [[skills#perception|Perception]] thanks to Hargash’s chanting. Hargash won’t hear anything until someone attacks. 

When the characters enter this room, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> This cavernous chapel is dominated by a towering statue originally crafted as a representation of the dwarven deity Moradin. It has been crudely transformed into an image of the bizarre insect deity you’ve seen throughout the temple. Smaller statues of dwarven gods and heroes, similarly disfigured, stand against the walls. Four basins on raised platforms stand in the four corners of the chapel. A rubblechoked passage leads away to the north. 
> 
> Kneeling before the great statue of the insect god is a stout duergar in green robes. He is flanked by pair of scorpions the size of wolves, and a monstrous spider clings to the towering statue above him. Another duergar arrayed in chainmail and armed with a maul stands protectively at his back. The kneeling duergar is praying loudly in grotesque utterances of some unholy language. 

If Hargash becomes aware of the characters before they attack, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The chanting stops suddenly, and the kneeling duergar leaps to his feet and turns toward you. His gaunt face is twisted in a rictus of hatred and madness. He raises a twitching finger, points at you, and shouts in Common, “Slay them in the name of Chitteruk!” 

## Tactics 
In the first round of combat, Hargash uses verminous blast to create another insect ally and injure as many heroes as possible. The giant scorpions and the duergar shock trooper advance to engage the characters in melee. The ogre spider closes with its chosen target. In the following rounds of combat, Hargash moves just out of melee range to ensure his verminous minions can benefit from aura of Chitteruk. He targets melee-oriented adventurers with web bolt to hamper their movement and uses curse of Chitteruk as often as possible on heroes suffering ongoing poison damage. Hargash does not shrink from melee. The duergar shock trooper targets characters in combat with the scorpions attempting to flank characters to increase its chances of hitting with its maul. When bloodied, it uses enlarge and then moves adjacent to Hargash, using its reach to protect its master.

The giant scorpions attack the closest heroes in melee, relentlessly biting and stinging until slain. The ogre spider leaps about the chapel, targeting random adventurers as often as possible. When Hargash is bloodied, he and his remaining minions retreat to the pools in the northern end of the room to make use their healing powers. Hargash makes his last stand there, fighting to the death to protect the temple of his imaginary god.

## Features of the Area 
**Illumination:** The four pools in this area glow with soft red and blue light, providing dim illumination to the entire chapel. Note that all of the foes except the giant scorpions have darkvision. 

**Ceiling:** The ceiling is 30 feet high. 

**Columns:** The columns are blocking terrain. 

**Statue of Chitteruk:** The statue of Chitteruk exudes a palpable evil. Good creatures adjacent to it suffer a -1 penalty to saving throws. 

**Blue Pools:** The crystal-clear water in these pools is still blessed by Moradin. A character that drinks from one (a standard action) can immediately regain an additional 5 hit points. This can only be done once an encounter.  The water loses this property if removed from the temple. 

**Red Pools:** The murky, red water in these pools has been cursed by the dread power of the great meteorite. If Hargash drinks from one of these pools (a standard action), he regains 31 hit points. If a character, other then Cassendra, drinks from one of these pools, he or she suffers the following attack: +9 vs. Fortitude; 2d6+4 poison damage and ongoing 5 poison damage (save ends). 

**Pit:** This shallow pit is only 5 feet deep. A creature the falls into it suffers no damage but falls prone. 

**Statues:** The statues are blocking terrain and provide cover to adjacent creatures.
