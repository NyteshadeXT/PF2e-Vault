The shard slave, a remnant of Xennul trapped in the shrine, waits in the main room, hoping to dominate one or more of the characters so that it may use their body to search for the shard that was taken from Xennul. A depression in the center of the room and patches of treacherous flooring present terrain obstacles and hazards for the characters.

When the characters enter the shrine, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The ceiling of the shrine’s dome glows with a faint blue radiance, illuminating the structure slightly. An antechamber with glass basins set on either side opens into the main chamber. There, narrow steps descend about 6 feet down into a rectangular depression in the floor with some sort of glass disc at its center. Beyond the depression, a pair of the strange glass guardians wait unmoving.

When the characters move into the main room, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> You sense movement from a shadowed alcove beyond the motionless guardians, which appear to be glass statues. An ethereal humanoid figure floats forward, whispering in your minds of its precious shard as it reaches toward you with long, wispy tendrils. Although humanoid, its gaunt features, gaping orifices, and wormlike tongue resemble nothing familiar. Such an abomination could only have been spawned in some alien realm.

Tactics The shard slave uses dominating tendril to try to dominate or kill one or more characters. Dominated characters hear the shard whispering in their minds that they must retrieve the shard of power for Xennul while it’s attached. It will try to use call of the shard early in the fight when at least two characters are in range, and then spend an action point to use double attack on two different characters if its tendrils are unattached. If it’s surrounded, it will either use shard reflection to escape or use shard burst to push away enemies and then spend its action point to make a tendril attack. The shard slave will direct any character it’s dominating to attack arcane spellcasters or those who have the ability to move its dominated victims away from it. The hazardous terrain in the shrine doesn’t affect the shard slave

### Features of the Area 
**Illumination:** The pair of magical fonts filled with glowing water provide bright, bluish-white light out to 15 feet. Elsewhere, the last light of the day seeping through the glass walls creates dim light in the main chamber. 

**Magical Fonts:** The power of the meteorite shard still infuses the shrine, creating the lighted water. If a character douses his or her weapon or implement in the water (a minor action), his or her next attack made before the end of his or her next turn deals radiant damage in addition to its normal damage types. 

**Depression:** A series of four narrow steps leads to the bottom of a six-foot depression within the main chamber. Set at the bottom is a circle of thick glass with a 2-inch by 6-inch by 1-inch impression within it. This once housed the meteorite shard. Each square in the depression is difficult terrain. A character can make a DC 10 [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] check or [[skills#acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check to treat these squares as normal terrain during his or her turn while moving through these squares. On a failure, the character falls prone in the first such square entered. A DC 10 [[skills#Arcana|Arcana]] check or [[skills#Religion|Religion]] check reveals that something of great power (the shard) once resided within the impression, and memories of it still linger throughout the shrine.

**Statues:** Each statue resembles a glass guardian but is simply inert glass. A statue has defenses of 4 and 3 hit points. Reducing a statue to 0 hit points causes it to explode: close burst 2; +5 vs. Reflex; 1d6 damage, and ongoing 5 damage (save ends). The statues provide cover. 

**Walls:** The walls are 15 feet high and merge into the domed ceiling. They are relatively smooth, with the only holds provided by sharp protrusions, so that a DC 15 [Climb](rules/actions/climb.md) check is required to climb. On a failure, the character takes 1d6 damage in addition to falling damage. 

**Treacherous Flooring:** Three types of hazardous terrain within the main chamber may cause the characters difficulty. Each type fills two squares (see map) and looks similar to the surrounding flooring, making it difficult to detect. The shard slave is unaffected by this terrain. 

* Spiked Flooring (X): Small, sharp glass spikes stick out of the floor. 
* Sticky Flooring (Y): The floor is strangely tacky, gripping at anything that comes in contact with it. 
* Smooth Flooring (Z): The floor is extremely smooth and slippery.

### Treasure
A third font stands at the back of the shrine. Instead of holding water, it contains a pane of purple glass. Lying on top of or against this font is a Hat of the Magi, a Dread Helm, Ghost Oil and a small pouch with 10 gp. Also, see the Scrying Font sidebar at the end of this adventure.

> [!warning]
> What if a Character is Killed by the Shard Slave? 
> 
> If the shard slave manages to kill a character, it will inhabit that character’s body, pushing the character’s soul into the background rather than killing him or her. At that point, the next attack that hits the shard slave (and that doesn’t reduce it to 0 hit points) will seem to shatter its body and vaporize it. In actuality, it has entered and taken control of the dead character’s body. If appropriate, get that character’s player to go along with the ruse. Give him or her the shard slave’s key motivations toward the goal of retrieving its shard. If the ruse is later discovered and the shard slave is forced out of the character through a ritual or other means, the character resumes control.

> [!warning]
> Scrying Font
> 
> The font in the back of the room still holds some power. Any character trained in [[skills#arcana|Arcana]] or [[skills#Religion|Religion]] who comes within 10 feet of the font will sense the power held within it. With investigation, a DC 10 [[skills#arcana|Arcana]] check or DC 12 [[skills#religion|Religion]] check will reveal that the font will operate as a limited scrying device. Determining its operation requires another check: DC 15 [[skills#arcana|Arcana]], DC 17 [[skills#religion|Religion]], or DC 15 [[skills#Thievery|Thievery]] (fooling about with it). Success indicates that a character must make contact with the purple stone and channel energy into it. Doing so reveals either the general location of the shard slave’s meteorite shard in the mine found in the adventure The Hammer Falls.  This vision is replaced by one of a fortress at the head of a valley..

> Sending the following to the player using the scrying font:
> The vision suddenly shatters and is replaced with an overwheling sense of malign disorder almost crushing in the weight of it's mere presence.  You return from the vision with blood running from your face.  With it the fading image of a meteor streaking toward you.  Strange crystals protruding from it's rocky form.
