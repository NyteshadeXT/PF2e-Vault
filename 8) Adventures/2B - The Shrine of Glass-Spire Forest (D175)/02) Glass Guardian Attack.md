When the characters enter the grounds near the shrine, read: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Erected in the center of a small clearing ahead of you is a shrine of opaque glass. Its smooth dome is formed from a single piece of light blue glass that caps a series of fused spires of various earthy colors. A dark archway to your left presents the only entrance, but before you can investigate further, scorpionlike creatures made from the same stuff as the spires dart into the clearing and advance on your position. 

### Tactics 
The nestlings will climb nearby spires to reach positions where they can use spire leap. The adult glass guardians use piercing shard to fire glass shards at the group before engaging the nearest enemy with lancing claw attacks. They fight to the death, since they were bred to guard the shrine.

### Features of the Area 
**Illumination:** Bright. The party enters the clearing at dusk, but the spires enhance the fading light. 

**Entrance to the Shrine:** A large glass door sits within the recessed archway. The door is closed but has a single, rectangular pane of purple glass set into its center. Striking the pane with a fragment from any of the glass spires will cause the pane to resonate with a high pitch for 20 seconds (3 rounds), and then the door will open. The door can also be forced open with a DC 18 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check or a DC 17 [[skills#Thievery|Thievery]] check. 

**Shrine:** The outer shrine walls are constructed of sharp, ridged glass spires. They extend upward 15 feet to the edge of the dome, which climbs another 10 feet to its apex. Climbing the walls requires a DC 15 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check; with any failure, the character takes 1d6 damage from the sharp edges in addition to falling damage. Movement on the slick domed roof requires a DC 10 [[skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check to avoid slipping and falling off the roof. 

**Spires:** The freestanding spires in the area rise to a height of between 10 and 20 feet (see map). Climbing the spires requires a DC 10 [Climb](rules/actions/climb.md) check; with any failure, the character takes 1d6 damage in addition to any falling damage. The nestlings can automatically climb these surfaces. 

**Shattered Spires (S):** These areas within the clearing are difficult terrain. Any character moving through the square must make a DC 10 [[skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] or [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check or take 1d6 damage from the sharp shards. 

**Terrain Outside the Clearing:** All terrain outside the clearing and the path is difficult terrain because of the broken spires littering the area. 

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> The glass guardians have defeated other enemies.  On a nearby corpse players can find some badly damaged leather armor, a short sword, a Cloak of Repute and Chimera Thread.
