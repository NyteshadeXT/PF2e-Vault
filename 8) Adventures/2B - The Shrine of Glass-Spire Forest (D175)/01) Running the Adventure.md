# Adventure Hooks

**The Calling**
While traveling near the strange old wall, one of the characters hears the sound of glass wind chimes that none of the others can hear. Mixed in with the chimes are whispers that speak of powerful magic, ancient lore, and power to be found. If followed, the whispers lead the character to an entrance in the wall and from there to the Glass-Spire Forest.

**The Whispering Shard**
An adventurer who managed to return from the Glass-Spire Forest brought back a piece of one of the glass spires as a memento. The chunk of brown glass comes into a player character’s possession, and that character begins having dreams of the forest while whispers in his or her mind speak of a priceless treasure concealed there. The character gains the knowledge of how to reach the Glass-Spire Forest.

**Tale of the Glass Forest**
Stories of a shrine among a “glass forest” beyond the wall have existed for a long time. Recently, a pair of adventurers returned from beyond the wall with a tale of a strange forest of glass spires that shriek like giant glass chimes when the wind blows. They have no wish to return to the forest but are willing to provide the location for a price.

After crossing beyond the great wall, a half-day’s travel brings the characters to the Glass-Spire Forest as dusk sets in. When the characters see the forest, read: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Ahead, you see a strange sight. The late-afternoon sun glints off the tops of many tall glass spires of various earthy colors standing at different angles. The land has been warped and twisted, forming a forest of glass spires. As the wind swirls among the strange formations, a soft but high-pitched keening rises. Sharp glass shards carpet the ground, making travel through this “ forest” difficult.

## Skill Challenge - Navigating the Forest

Shattered glass litters the ground and gives off strange reflections due to the oddly angled spires.  Navigating this forest is going to be a difficult and dangerous process.

**Level:** 2 (40 xp)
**Complexity:** 3 (requires 8 successes before 3 failures)
**Primary Skills:**  Acrobatics, Arcana, Athletics, Lore (Appropriate Subskill), Nature, Perception, Stealth
**Secondary Skills:** Survival, Medicine

### Primary Skills
**Acrobatics (DC 10):**  Balance on broken sections of glass, move through narrow spaces between sharp fragments, and use acrobatic maneuvers to avoid scraping against sharp shards. This skill can earn a maximum of 2 successes.

**Arcana (DC 15):** Extend your senses outward to notice the taint of the meteorite shard still within the glass spires of the forest, sensing the direction that this energy is emanating from (the shrine). This skill can earn a maximum of 1 success.

**Athletics (DC 12):** Leap over piles of shards, safely climb spires to see the path, and help party members get through tight spaces in the path. This skill can earn a maximum of 2 successes.

**Lore (DC 15):** Use knowledge of the history and stories of the Glass-Spire Forest to identify the reputed location of the shrine. This skill can earn a maximum of 1 success.

**Nature (DC 10):** The Glass-Spire Forest has similarities to a real forest. Use nature knowledge to choose the best path and avoid dangerous places. This skill can earn a maximum of 2 successes. After the second failure, if a character has made a successful Perception check to detect pursuit, Nature can also be used to try to throw off pursuit (DC 15), which removes the glass guardian nestlings from the combat encounter. This check can be used only once and counts as 1 success.

**Perception (DC 15):** Find safe paths and the best route to the shrine. This check is more difficult because of the way the glass spires warp the light, as well as the fact that the spire edges appear smooth but are actually very sharp. This skill can earn a maximum of 2 successes. After the second failure, a secondary Perception check is opened (one check only) to hear the sounds of the pursuing glass guardian nestlings (DC 10). Success opens up Stealth or Nature to throw off pursuit (no success/failure to overall challenge).

**Stealth (DC 15):** Opens up after the second failure when a secondary Perception check is successful to notice pursuit. A character can gain 1 additional challenge success and remove the glass guardian nestlings from the combat encounter. This check can be used only once.

**Secondary Skills**
**Survival (DC 12):** Because of the alien landscape, which has some resemblance to the Underdark, this skill can be used in place of a Nature check, with a slightly harder DC.

**Medicine (DC 15):** Successfully pad hands and feet, or bandage minor wounds during the journey (one check, can be aided at DC 10). This check doesn’t count toward the skill challenge success or failure, but if successful, it adds a +5 bonus to each character’s Endurance check if the challenge is failed.

**Success:** If the characters earn 8 successes, they find their way to the shrine without alerting a nearby glass guardian to their presence and manage to avoid causing themselves undue injuries from brushing against the sharp shards (no Endurance check required). The dome of the shrine comes into view shortly thereafter, and the characters will enter a combat encounter with the glass guardians when they arrive.

**Failure:** With each failed skill check, the characters make mistakes in their journey, causing them harm and/or alerting glass guardians in the area to their location, which will create a more dangerous combat encounter when they arrive at the shrine.

   **First Failure:** The character failing the check accidentally causes a nearby spire to shatter, sending shards flying in all directions. Loses one hit die of healing during their next rest.

   **Second Failure:** The character failing the check alerts a pair of glass guardian nestlings to the group’s presence. The nestlings will track the characters back to the shrine and join in the combat encounter there. This failure opens up Perception to notice (hear) the guardian’s pursuit, potentially allowing the use of a Stealth check or Nature check to throw the glass guardian nestlings off the trail.

   **Third (total) Failure:** Each character must make a DC 10 Endurance check or lose 2 hit dies of healing during their next rest due to injuries sustained while picking their way through the deadly glass shards. Additionally, an extra glass guardian notices the group’s presence and joins the combat encounter at the shrine. The dome of the shrine will come into view shortly thereafter, and the characters will enter a combat encounter with the glass guardians when they arrive.
