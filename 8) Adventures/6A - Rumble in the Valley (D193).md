# Background
Kodan is an experienced hobgoblin commander, who leads a band of raiders called the Talons, so named for their hit-and-run tactics patterned after those of certain dragons. Hearing of opportunities for wealth and power, he took his band to the Chaos Scar. 

The Talons’ first mission was to be a simple one: Raid a passing merchant caravan on its way to Restwell Keep. Kodan quickly found that the area was not going to offer the easy pickings he had expected. His band was repelled by a combined force of guards from the keep and the adventurers. As the Talons retreated, though, the group encountered a doppelganger assassin named Linn and a bullywug priest named Primpel, both seeking revenge for the adventurers’ previous meddling. 

The keep and adventuring parties were constant threats that couldn’t be dealt with as long as all the monstrous factions worked on their own. Kodan was struck with an idea: Instead of trying to carve out his own piece of the Chaos Scar, as so many others had done, he could unite all the inhabitants of the Scar under his banner by proving that he was a smart, capable, and powerful leader. To this end, he began to contact representatives of the caves’ inhabitants. Kodan soon encountered others who had experiences similar to his own, and he focused his attention on them. 

Using the talents of various monsters seeking revenge, Kodan took over a set of caves and has turned it into a massive trap. He doesn’t intend to kill the adventurers in the caves but rather weaken them so that he and his now-reinforced Talons can eliminate them, in full view of emissaries from important Chaos Scar factions. With the adventurers out of the way, and having demonstrated his might, Kodan intends to rule the Chaos Scar.

# Adventure Synopsis
The adventurers are summoned by [[Ardia Ironleaf]] about another quest into the Chaos Scar. Ardia explains that elemental creatures are attacking her trade caravans and have been seen coming from a newly spotted cave entrance. She promises wealth and glory, as well as a chance to save innocent lives, if the adventurers investigate the incidents.

In truth, the quest is a ruse. The real Ardia has been captured and replaced by Linn. Kodan has prepared a trap for the adventurers within one of the caves of the Chaos Scar, utilizing the talents of Slik, Primpel, and Barulg.

The adventurers explore the cave, finding it surprisingly easy to navigate. They encounter little trouble until they reach a large chamber containing the wounded body of the true Ardia, guarded by several mud creatures. Entering the chamber triggers a cave-in, blocking the entrance. The only exit is through two sets of tunnels, designed to split the party into two groups and weaken them with traps and hazards to give the Talons the edge in the final battle.

At the end of the tunnels, a small force of sentries loyal to Kodan guard a stone outcropping that looks out over the Chaos Scar valley. The guards have strict orders not to kill the adventurers, but to delay them while Kodan makes final preparations.

In the valley below, witnessed by monstrous emissaries, Kodan and the Talons fight the party in one last showdown. If Kodan defeats the adventurers, he proves his worth to lead the monsters of the Chaos Scar in an attack on Restwell Keep. If he falls, the adventurers end a grave threat to the keep.

# Running the Adventure
- **Caravan Troubles Again:** [[Ardia Ironleaf]] is looking for the party. Something about her caravans being attacked by elemental creatures from the Scar. Sound like she’s willing to pay lots of coin.

# The Adventure Begins
When you’re ready to begin the adventure, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Within the walls of Restwell Keep, you’ve made a name for yourselves as heroes, ready to protect the innocent, rescue the endangered, and thwart the evil. As you walk along the streets, you’re thanked by passersby whom you have helped or those who just know you by reputation.
> 
> So you aren’t surprised to once again be called to another adventure at the behest of Ardia Ironleaf. In the past, she has needed help dealing with the dangers of the Chaos Scar, which are numerous, to clear the way for her trade caravans. Ardia asks you to investigate a possible incursion by elementals that threaten one of her trade routes. As always, she offers to pay well.
> 
> “This should be short work for such experienced adventurers as you,” she says, smiling. Without waiting for your answer, she hands you a map to the spot where she believes the creatures are coming from. She encourages you to leave quickly, for she has another caravan moving through tomorrow.

In fact, the person who the adventurers are meeting with is not [[Ardia Ironleaf]], but the doppelganger Linn, who has replaced the merchant to lure the party into Kodan’s trap. She doesn’t have the information to answer many questions the adventurers might pose. If pressed, ”Ardia” claims that her scouts provided the tip and are back out on patrol.

This excuse might make the adventurers suspicious. With a successful DC 29 [[sense-motive|Sense Motive]] check, a character senses that Ardia seems to be upset about something. If challenged, she explains that she is annoyed at the cost of doing business in the keep. (In reality, the doppelganger wants revenge for the death of her brothers.) If the adventurers continue to press her, she excuses herself on the pretext that she has another important meeting to attend.

The fake Ardia pays the party 100 gp up front, with a promise of triple that on successful completion of the mission. If that doesn’t persuade the adventurers, the doppelganger increases the offer as needed—she intends for them never to return, so payment isn’t a problem.

The map provided by "Ardia" is detailed and accurate, leading the party right to the cave entrance. The journey is surprisingly quiet for a trip into the Chaos Scar—the first clue that something is not quite right about the mission.

If the characters manage to discover that Arida is a fake, the doppelganger is willing to reveal what she knows of Kodan’s plan. Linn tells the group that Kodan has gained the allegiance of a number of Chaos Scar creatures and seeks to prove his worth by defeating the party. She pleads for her life and tells them that unless they go to the cave, the real Ardia will be killed. If they spare her, she betrays them at the first opportunity.

## Entering the Cave
The cave immediately begins to slope downward, twisting to the east. With a successful DC 26 [[skills#nature|Nature]] check, a character notices that the caves aren’t entirely natural: Someone has recently done work to improve them.

If the adventurers take time to search more thoroughly, or decide to turn back, you can encourage them to continue forward with the sound of an anguished cry from ahead: the voice of the real Ardia.

## Encounter 1: Between Rust and a Hard Place
**Encounter Difficulty:** 
- [x] Low (60 XP) Level 11

![[6A - Rumble in the Valley (D193)-20240820111648698.webp]]

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 2: [[Mudborn]] M
 - 2: [[rust-monster-enhanced|Rust Monster]] R
 - 1: [[Tar ooze]] G
 - 1: [[Ardia Ironleaf]] D

```encounter
name: Between Rust and a Hard Place
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 2: [[Mudborn]] 
- 2: [[Enhanced Rust Monster]]
- 1: [[Tar Ooze]]
```

The map for Event 1 shows the entrance and the  cavern where Ardia is being held. She is badly injured and needs attention if she is to survive. Once the adventurers enter the cave, the tunnel leading back out starts to collapse.

When the adventurers get close enough to see inside, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> You stand at the entrance to a large chamber, divided into two sections. The more distant half is illuminated by torches on the walls, placed to give you a good view of a sight you were clearly intended to witness. 
> 
> Your patron Ardia—battered, beaten, and bloody— hangs pitifully from manacles attached by chains to the far wall. There’s no way the she could have arrived before you, and her wounds show that she has suffered long-term abuse.
> 
> Surrounding her are two humanoid shapes seemingly made of living mud. Within their chests, covered by the muck, are two wriggling insect-like creatures, whose antennae occasionally poke out of the disgusting slime. 
> 
> Ardia tries to choke out a warning, but the pain of her injuries, reinforced by a brutal blow from one of the mud creatures, silences her before she can finish. The monsters emit a low gurgling sound as they turn to face you, and the cat-sized insects burst forth, leaving a bubbling mud trail behind them. 
> 
> Behind you, a loud crashing sound reverberates through the tunnels.

At the start of the first round of combat, the adventurers hear a loud rumbling: the beginning of a cave-in. On the second round, the entrance tunnel fills with rubble. On the third round, rubble spills out into the cavern, pushing anyone in it into the far chamber. (The rubble-strewn area is difficult terrain.)

Any creature that tries to escape back through the entrance tunnel on the first round gets caught in the falling rock, taking `dice: 6d10+15` damage. The creature is immobilized and takes ongoing 10 damage until it escapes. The creature can make a saving throw to avoid the collapse, taking half damage on a save. A trapped creature can try to escape once per round, and escaping requires a DC 29 Athletics check.

After the cave-in ends, returning through the entrance passage is no longer possible. The only exit is the tunnel at the far side of the cavern.

### Tactics
The [[mudborn]] are under orders to stop enemies from reaching [[Ardia Ironleaf|Ardia]]. They stay near her, launching their mud ball attacks at anyone who tries to approach. The enhanced rust monsters were imprisoned within the mudborn, where they starved nearly to death. They home in on the character with the most metal to devour. 

The gelatinous cube was prodded into place to prevent an early exit. It spends the first round moving into better position to engulf prey. It avoids the mudborn (which have no flesh to devour) but does not hesitate to overrun a rust monster while trying to get to a character.

### Features of the Area
**Light:** Torches along the walls of the farther cavern shed bright light.

**Ardia (D):** The elf has been tortured and will die in a few rounds if she is not tended to. Anyone adjacent to her can make a DC 29 [[skills#Medicine|Medicine]] check to stabilize her. Using a healing power on Ardia automatically stabilize her. Otherwise, she makes a death saving throw at the end of each round and dies after three failures. Even if stabilized, Ardia barely clings to life and is unconscious for the remainder of the adventure. Rescuing Ardia fulfills a minor quest.


**QUEST: Cavern Rescue (Minor Quest)** 
- [x] Low (30 XP) Level 11
Returning Ardia to town alive earns the characters the quest reward.

## Encounter 2: Tunnels of Terror
**Encounter Difficulty:** 
- [x] Moderate (40 XP) Level 11

Kodan knows he can’t stand up to the adventurers at full strength. His goal is to weaken them as much as possible, perhaps eliminating one or two of them if he’s lucky. To that end, with the aid of Barulg’s construction and forging, and traps designed by Slik, he has laid out the tunnels to harry and weaken the party. Kodan still needs a few adventurers to escape, however, so he can finish them off in view of those he’s trying to impress.

After a short time exploring, the party comes to a spot where the tunnel forks. Both directions are blocked by solid metal gates, each connected by a chain to a pulley in the opposite tunnel. Each slab requires at least two characters to raise it by pulling on its chain, and it falls back as soon as the chain is released or fewer than two characters hold it. (The chain is long enough to allow those holding it to move past the open slab if it is opened by the other chain.) Unless the adventurers come up with a way around this obstacle, they will have no choice but to split into two groups, each passing simultaneously into the opposing tunnels. After passing these obstacles, the groups are reunited at the exit chamber.

Each group must deal with two of the obstacles laid out by the Talons, represented by short skill challenges that affect the final encounter. Tailor these challenges to the group’s abilities, choosing two from those described below , in whichever order you want. These challenges use a variety of skills, so they shouldn’t be too difficult for the characters to overcome. If the players come up with a way to avoid splitting the party, they should easily bypass this challenge and emerge stronger than Kodan expects.  There is a strange sense of confounding in the air.  Only give the players information about the primary and secondary skills allowed.  They must discover success criteria on their own.

> [!tip]+ Skill Challenge
> # Barulg’s Infernal Forge
> 
> The tunnel walls transition into intricately carved works of metal and obsidian, engraved with devilish visages. Barulg, through his infernal masters, has infused his craftsmanship with primal fears of the living: the dark, being lost, and fire. The fiendish images swallow all light in the area (including any magical light sources) and launch blasts of invisible fire. 
> 
> **Level:** 7 (40 XP)
> **Complexity:** 1 (requires 4 successes before 3 failures)
> **Time Frame:** Each character can make a skill check in this challenge once per minute.
> **Primary Skills:**  [[skills#Crafting|Crafting]], [[skills#Perception|Perception]], [[skills#Society|Society]]
> **Secondary Skills:** [[skills#Perception|Perception]]
> **Special:** After any character makes a skill check, regardless of the skill used and the success or failure of the check, a random character takes `dice: 2d6+4` 2d6 + 4 fire damage.
> 
> ### Primary Skills
> **Crafting (DC 29, 1 success):** The character relies on familiarity with construction to advance carefully.
> - **Success:**  "You run your hands along the engraved metalwork, feeling for inconsistencies in the structure. Your knowledge of construction reveals subtle gaps in the floor and walls—places where the fire traps are least likely to trigger. You guide the group forward, step by careful step."
> - **Failure:**  "Your instincts tell you that the infernal craftsmanship follows a logical design, but as you attempt to gauge the safest route, the ground shifts beneath your feet. A sudden burst of searing heat erupts from the walls, forcing you to stumble blindly forward."
> 
> **Perception (DC 29, 1 success):**  Despite the lack of light, the character uses other senses to find the path.
> - **Success:**  "With no light to guide you, you focus on sound and touch—the faint hum of unseen magic, the whisper of air shifting through hidden vents. At the last moment, you halt the group just before a section of floor releases a surge of invisible flame, allowing them to slip past unharmed."
> - **Failure:**  "You strain to listen, to feel, to sense anything beyond the overwhelming darkness. But the walls seem to close in, warping your perception. A blast of infernal fire erupts from the carvings, licking at your skin as you scramble to move forward."
> 
> **Society (DC 29, 1 success):** The character recognizes the art on the walls as duergar handiwork, allowing him or her to figure out the best places to step based on their patterns. Success with this check, in addition to counting toward the overall challenge reduces damage taken by half.
> - **Success:**  "The intricate metal engravings, the sinister duergar artistry—you recognize it for what it is. This is a warning as much as it is a trap. You decipher the placement of each visage, identifying the safest path through the forge’s deathly corridor. Your insight helps the entire party, making the flames less lethal."
> - **Failure:**  "You recall something about duergar craftsmanship—patterns, symbols—but the knowledge escapes you when you need it most. You step forward, thinking you’ve found a safe route, only to hear a metallic click. A roaring wave of fire answers your mistake."
> 
> ### Secondary Skills
> **Perception (DC 26, no successes):** The character tries to anticipate the fire blasts. No success is gained, but he or she takes no damage from the next blast of fire that targets that character.  Alternately, the character uses intuition to warn the others about an oncoming blast of fire. No success is gained, but each other character takes only half damage from the next fire blast that attacks him or her.
> - **Success (self):**  "You feel the air shift, a surge of heat building just before it erupts. Instinct kicks in—you duck and roll just as a blast of invisible fire erupts overhead, avoiding the searing pain altogether."
> - **Success (group):**  "A faint change in the air—a warning just before the fire strikes. ‘Move!’ you shout, shoving an ally aside. The fire erupts, but thanks to your quick reaction, the worst of it is avoided."
> - **Failure:**  "You think you sense something—an unnatural stillness, an ominous quiet. But before you can react, a gout of fire explodes from the wall, burning into flesh and armor alike."
> 
> ### Success
> The party reaches the end of the hall, and their light sources flare to life again.
> 
> "With one final step, you cross into open space—and suddenly, light returns. Your torches and magic flares to life, revealing the end of the corridor. The choking darkness is behind you, and though the heat of the forge still lingers, you have emerged unscathed."
> 
> ### Failure 
> The adventures emerge with infernal darkness clinging to their souls. The group gains the **Marked by Barulg** trait: Any character who scores a hit against Barulg in the final encounter takes 5 fire damage.
> 
> "The dark does not let go easily. As you stagger out of the corridor, the inky blackness clings to you. The searing heat of the forge is now a part of you—when you finally face Barulg, his fire will recognize you as one of its own."

> # Linn’s Paranoid Gauntlet
> 
> The rocky walls change to a mirror-like substance, reflecting thousands of things both real and false. Images, voices, and sounds appear all around the characters, who become increasingly unsure if the other party members are real or have been replaced by something sinister. The adventurers must shake these feelings to emerge safely from the maze of mirrors.

> **Secondary Skills:** [[skills#Diplomacy|Diplomacy]], [[skills#Intimidation|Intimidation]]
> **Special:** Each round, any character who has not succeeded at a primary skill check takes `dice: 2d6+4` 2d6 + 4 psychic damage.
> 
> ### Primary Skills
> **Arcana (DC 29, 1 success):** The character uses his or her magical senses to get a fix on what is real and what is magically created.
>- **Success:** "Focusing on the ebb and flow of magic, you extend your senses beyond the deception. The threads of illusion unravel just slightly, revealing glimpses of the true path ahead. The mirror-like walls ripple as if they resent being exposed, but for a moment, clarity prevails."
>- **Failure:** "You reach out with your magical senses, but the web of illusion twists in response. The reflections shift with your thoughts, warping to match your worst fears. Your mind is flooded with an overwhelming sense of doubt—what if _you_ are the illusion?"
> 
> **Diplomacy (DC 29, 1 success):**  The character gives a stirring speech to convince the others of his or her identity and trustworthiness.
> - **Success:** "You steady your voice and speak with conviction, reminding your allies of who you are and what you've been through together. Though the whispers claw at the edges of your words, your sincerity rings true. A flicker of recognition passes through your companions' eyes, strengthening their resolve against the illusion."
> - **Failure:** "You try to reason with your allies, but doubt clouds their eyes. Every reassurance you offer is twisted by the whispers, echoed back with a cruel edge. 'Isn't that exactly what an imposter would say?' the illusions taunt. For a moment, even _you_ wonder if you can trust your own voice."
> 
> **Perception (DC 29, 1 success):** The character trusts his or her intuition to tune out the false voices and images.
> - **Success:** "Ignoring the distractions, you focus on the subtle details—the way sound bounces unnaturally, the way the reflections lag just a fraction of a second behind. Your instincts guide you, separating truth from trickery. A faint shimmer in the distance reveals a path forward, if you trust yourself enough to take it."
> - **Failure:** "Your eyes dart between reflections, trying to find inconsistencies, but every time you think you’ve found something real, it shifts. The illusions respond to your focus, twisting to match your suspicions. Your own face sneers back at you, lips curling into words you _almost_ said. Which ones are real? Are any?"
> 
> ### Secondary Skills
> **Diplomacy (DC 23, no successes):** The character employs verbal gymnastics to confuse the various illusions, although his or her own reality is still in doubt. No success is gained, but each other character receives a +2 bonus to the next primary skill check he or she makes this round.
> 
> "With careful words and steady reassurance, you weave a verbal counterpoint to the illusions’ falsehoods. Though the uncertainty remains, your allies find their footing just a little stronger. They might not believe everything you say—but they believe enough."
> 
> **Intimidation (DC 26, no successes):** The character forcefully asserts his or her existence. Although this tactic is effective, the other party members grow more distrustful of each other. No success is gained, but this character gains a +2 bonus to all primary skill checks during the challenge. All other characters take a –2 penalty to their next primary skill checks.
> 
> "You slam your fist against a mirrored wall, your voice cutting through the madness with raw force. 'I AM REAL!' The reflections recoil, momentarily uncertain, but so do your allies—your aggression plants a seed of doubt in their minds. Are you proving your existence… or hiding something?"
> 
> ### Success
> The bond between the adventurers helps to dispel the illusions and feelings of paranoia, leaving only a mild sense of doubt.
> 
> *"With effort, you push past the doubt and confusion, anchoring yourselves in what you know to be real. The distorted voices fade, the endless reflections waver, and the mirror-like walls ripple as if recoiling from your collective resolve. 
> 
> A final whisper slithers through the air—'Are you sure?'—but it is weak, desperate. Then, the illusion collapses. The twisted maze of mirrors shatters, leaving behind a dimly lit path forward. Though unease still lingers, you know who you are, and that is enough… for now."*
> 
> ### Failure 
> The adventurers can’t shake their suspicions about what they experience. The group gains the **Marked by Linn** trait: Any character who scores a hit against Linn in the final encounter cannot regain hit points until the end of his or her next turn.
> 
> *"The reflections refuse to settle, the whispers twist familiar words into mockeries, and the doubt festers in your minds. Every step feels uncertain, every glance at an ally tinged with suspicion.
> 
> The path finally emerges, but something is wrong. The illusion has faded, yet its grip remains. An invisible weight settles in your chests, an echo of paranoia that won’t fully fade. The doubt clings to you like a shadow, and a lingering voice in your mind asks: _What if you're wrong?_"*

> **Special:** Each character must earn at least 1 success  with a primary skill in order to proceed, even if the group has achieved 4 successes.
> 
> ### Primary Skills
> **Athletics (DC 29, 1 success):** The character uses brute force, pushing through while holding his or her breath.
> - **Success:** "Muscles burning, you drive forward through the thick, clinging mud. Every step is a battle as the muck drags at your legs, but sheer willpower propels you onward. You break through a particularly deep patch, gasping as your feet find solid ground beneath the surface."
> - **Failure:** "You brace yourself and push forward, but the mud is relentless. It tightens like a vice around your limbs, pulling you down inch by inch. Your breath comes in ragged gasps as exhaustion sets in. The more you struggle, the deeper you sink."
> 
> **Nature (DC 24, 1 success):**  By drawing upon his or her experience in swampy terrain, the character is able to find solid footing amid the deeper mud.
> - **Success:** "You study the patterns of shifting mud, searching for subtle ridges and firmer ground. With careful movements, you step in just the right places, finding solid footing where others would sink. The path forward begins to reveal itself."
> - **Failure:** "You attempt to find stable footing, but the mud is deceptive. What looked like a solid patch turns to sludge beneath your weight, swallowing your leg to the knee. The scent of rot rises as the shifting muck pulls you deeper into its clutches."
> 
> **Religion (DC 24, 1 success):** The character discerns that the earth and water bear traces of elemental energy tainted by chaos. Calling on divine powers that oppose elemental chaos causes the mud to part around the character. 
> - **Success:** "Closing your eyes, you reach out with your faith, sensing the taint in the mud. Whispering a prayer or invoking a warding gesture, you call upon divine power to push back against the creeping corruption. The water around you shudders, then parts slightly, making your path just a little clearer."
> - **Failure:** "You call upon your faith, but the tainted mud does not yield. It twists around you, seeping into your very being. Your skin tingles with an unnatural energy, and for a moment, you feel an overwhelming sense of wrongness—as if something ancient and chaotic is watching you struggle."
> 
> ### Secondary Skills
> **Athletics (DC 20, no successes):** No success is gained, but the character swims or wades through while dragging another character along, granting a +2 bonus to the next primary skill check made by another character. The character making this secondary skill check takes a –2 penalty to the next primary skill check he or she makes. 
> 
> "Gritting your teeth, you grab hold of a struggling ally and drag them through the sludge. Every muscle in your body screams in protest, but you refuse to let them sink. They find a steadier footing ahead, but the effort has taken its toll on you."
> 
> **Religion (DC 20, no successes):** The character meditates on a blessing to help another character ward off elemental chaos. No success is gained, but the other character gains a +2 bonus to the next primary skill check. The character making this secondary skill check cannot make primary Religion checks for the rest of the challenge.
> 
> "You murmur a quiet blessing, focusing your will on an ally rather than yourself. Though the chaotic energy of the mud resists, your faith shields them, making their next steps just a little easier. As you finish, you feel drained, as if something in the swamp has stolen a fraction of your divine spark."
> 
> ### Success
> The party struggles through the tunnels and emerges from the mud.
> 
> "With one final push, you break free of the clinging, tainted mud, gasping as you stagger onto firmer ground. The tunnel stretches ahead, still damp and oppressive, but at least you are no longer sinking. The mud seems almost reluctant to release you, tendrils of thick sludge breaking away with a sickening slurp.
> 
> The corruption still lingers in the air, but you have passed through its grasp—mostly unscathed."*
> 
> ### Failure 
> The adventurers make it to the other side, but the chaos instilled in the mud seeps into their bodies. The group gains the **Marked by Primpel** trait: Any character who scores a hit against Primpel in the final encounter is weakened until the end of his or her next turn.
> 
> "At last, you claw your way out of the shifting mire, but something is wrong. Your limbs feel heavier, your breath shallower. A cold sensation lingers beneath your skin, as though the tainted mud has seeped into your very being.
> 
> The ground is solid beneath you now, but you can’t shake the feeling that the chaos of the swamp has left its mark. And as you move forward, you realize—it has."*

> 
> ### Primary Skills
> **Acrobatics (DC 29, 1 success):** The character dodges, slides, and weaves past the deadly traps.
> - **Success:** "With split-second reflexes, you twist and tumble through the deadly gauntlet. A pendulum blade whips past your shoulder as you slide beneath it, narrowly avoiding a pit that opens beneath your feet. Every movement is precise, every step perfectly timed. You land gracefully, past the worst of the traps—at least for now."
> - **Failure:** "You attempt to vault over a dart trap, but the ground shifts beneath you. A metal blade swings from the ceiling, forcing you to twist midair. Your footing falters, and pain flares as something sharp grazes your side. A hiss of released pressure signals another trap resetting behind you."
> 
> **Crafting (DC 24, 1 success):**  These traps are old hat to seasoned adventurers, and the character relies on his or her experience to bypass them.
> - **Success:** "You scan the hall, mentally dissecting the traps like a well-worn blueprint. The mechanisms are crude, but efficient—gears, pressure plates, and counterweights all working in concert. You reach out, jamming a gear with a stray piece of debris. A section of the trap system groans in protest, giving you and your allies an opening to advance."
> - **Failure:** "You pry open a panel, hoping to disable the mechanism within, but Slik’s craftsmanship is maddeningly intricate. A misplaced wire sparks, and suddenly, gears whir back to life. A section of the floor drops away at your feet, and you scramble to avoid the fresh hazard you just activated."
> 
> **Thievery (DC 24, 1 success):** The character temporarily sabotages one or more parts of the elaborate trap system, allowing passage.
> - **Success:** "With deft fingers, you trace the edges of a trigger mechanism, swiftly disengaging the pressure plate before it can activate. A pendulum blade slows, then stops mid-swing, giving the group a moment to move forward unharmed. The delicate sabotage leaves the rest of the system unaware—for now."
> - **Failure:** "You attempt to jam the mechanism of a dart trap, but Slik’s design is more complex than expected. As soon as you think you’ve disabled it, a hidden spring triggers, launching a flurry of darts in your direction. The traps here are not so easily fooled."
> 
> ### Secondary Skills
> **Athletics (DC 21, no successes):** The character temporarily forces the machinery to a halt, facing an attack to give the others a greater chance of success. No success is gained, but all other characters gain a +2 bonus to any primary skill checks this round. This character is automatically hit by the traps this round.
> 
> "With a determined grunt, you seize hold of a grinding cog and throw your weight against it. The machinery screeches in protest as you strain, bringing a section of the trap system to a temporary halt. Your allies surge forward while you hold the mechanism in place—until the backlash of pent-up energy sends shrapnel and blades flying in your direction."

> **Perception (DC 21, no successes):** The character observes a pattern to the traps’ activation. No success is gained, but all characters gain a +2 bonus to AC against the traps’ attack this turn.
> 
> "You pause, watching the deadly machines in motion, and a pattern emerges. The gears click in precise rhythm, the dart launchers fire in waves, and the pendulums move in a predictable arc. With a shout, you warn your allies of the safest timing to move, giving them a chance to evade the worst of the traps."
> 
> ### Success
> Through a combination of teamwork, timing, and tenacity, the party escapes the trapped tunnel.
> 
> "With a final leap, roll, or well-placed step, you clear the last of the traps. Behind you, pendulum blades swing back and forth in eerie synchronization, their mechanisms still whirring. The air is thick with the scent of oiled metal and the faint tang of poison, but you’ve made it through.
> 
> Ahead, the tunnel opens into a wider chamber, free from immediate danger—for now."*
> 
> ### Failure 
> The traps have introduced Slik’s custom poison into the adventurers’ blood. The group gains the **Marked by Slik** trait: Each of the adventurers takes a –2 penalty to all defenses against Slik’s attacks and has vulnerable 5 to Slik’s damage.
> 
> "You reach the end of the trapped corridor, but something is wrong. The sting of a dart, the scrape of a blade—somewhere along the way, Slik’s traps have done more than just wound you. A faint burning sensation creeps through your veins, and your movements feel sluggish.
> 
> Slik may not have stopped you, but he’s left his mark."

# Encounter 3: Valley Sentries
**Encounter Difficulty:**   
- [x] Low (60 XP) Level 11

![[6A Valley Sentries.webp]]

The two tunnels eventually converge, allowing the adventurers to reassemble near the exit (if they were split). Just outside, they hear occasional sounds of bickering in Undercommon. One more force waits to harass them as they emerge, in a further effort to weaken the party before the final confrontation. The sentries also give Kodan plenty of time to get ready for his crowning moment.

The adventurers can take a short rest before proceeding out of the cave. If they are carrying Ardia, they have time to lay her down in a safe spot. The monsters ignore the elf; besides not being a threat, she’s not on the list.

When the heroes advance to the outside, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A chill air sweeps across you as you make your way out of the tunnel, high on the slope of a rocky outcropping somewhere inside the Chaos Scar. You have seen much of the Scar in your time here, but you’ve never had quite this view of it. From here, it looks almost serene.
> 
> You don’t have much time to admire the view, though, for a sizable group awaits your arrival with obvious hostility. An ogre brandishing a massive morningstar dominates the scene, supported by a number of duergar. Two of the dark dwarves are holding the reins to a snapping drake, which they release when you emerge. A single mud creature quivers in place.
> 
> The ogre grins and hefts its weapon: “The boss wants ’em softened up. I call the short one.”

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 1: [[ogre-boss|Ogre Boss]] W
 - 1: [[Mudborn]] M
 - 2: [[frost-drake|Frost Drake]] A
 - 4: [[duergar-scout|Duergar Scout]] D

```encounter
name: EncounterName
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 1: [[Ogre Boss]] 
- 1: [[Mudborn]]
- 2: [[Frost Drake]]
- 4: [[Duergar Scout]]
```

The combat takes place on a rocky outcropping 50 feet above the valley. The jutting stone partially blocks the view of what lies below.

Anyone can peer over the edge and see that a small crowd of creatures of all sorts is gathering near the bottom of the cliff. The shape of the outcropping blocks the view of what they’re surrounding, which isn’t revealed until the adventurers descend farther. 

An adventurer might be knocked over the edge during the combat. If he or she survives the fall, that character gets an early glimpse of the gathering below. Kodan does not immediately attack but barks, “Get back up there. We’re not ready for you yet.” If the adventurer chooses not to return to the outcropping, the Talons attack with overwhelming superiority of numbers.

## Tactics
On the first round, two duergar thugs descend about 10 feet on rope ladders to signal the crowd below that the party has arrived. On the next round, they climb back up and move to join the fight. 

All of the sentries have been ordered not to kill any of the adventurers. With the exception of the frost drakes, the monsters do not attack anyone who appears to be unconscious. Once the adventurers outnumber the sentries, the survivors fight only until bloodied, then attempt to flee down the rope ladders. Those who get to the bottom join the crowd in the final encounter.

The ogre boss targets whoever looks the toughest in the party, preferring to attack dwarves, bigger creatures and defenders in heavy armor.

## Features of the Area
**Light:** If the adventurers arrive during the day, the area is brightly lit. At night, torches from the valley below shed dim light over the area.

**Rope Ladders:** These are secured by metal spikes to the cliff edge in four spots and extend to the valley floor. If a creature is pushed off the edge beside a ladder and fails the saving throw to avoid falling, it can attempt a DC 26 [[skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check to grab onto the ladder instead.  If the attempt fails creatures suffer `dice: 5d6` 5d6 falling damage. Creatures on the ladder gain partial cover from attackers on the cliff edge. If an adventurer descends more than 10 feet, he or she might be within range of some attacks from the monsters below—but they aren’t willing to start the fight until the party is on the ground.

# Encounter 4: Rumble in the Valley
**Encounter Difficulty:**   
- [x] Moderate (80 XP) Level 11

![[6A Rumble in the Valley.webp]]

The final battle for the Chaos Scar is here. Rope ladders lead to the valley, where representatives of the Chaos Scar’s inhabitants will witness the culmination of Kodan’s plan.

The party can take another short rest before venturing down. During that time a chant starts, at first low and growing progressively louder. At first, the words are inaudible and in a variety of rumbling monstrous speech. Gradually, the chant falls into unison, repeating “Talons” in Common over and over until the adventurers descend to the battlefield.

The only way to get down safely is on the ladders, each of which can hold the weight of two characters at a time. The adventurers will have to choose which ones to use, and in which order to descend, which dictates where they arrive in the valley. 

As they begin to descend, the chanting stops. Kodan takes this opportunity to rile up the spectators before the final battle. Read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> You make your way carefully down the rope ladders. After descending about 10 feet, you can more clearly see what’s waiting for you. A hobgoblin stands on a short cliff above the crowd of monsters and addresses you.
> 
> “The time of your oppression has come to an end. You have terrorized the denizens of the Chaos Scar long enough. We are the Talons, and we are here to see that justice is finally done.” 
> 
> There is a short cheer at the mention of the Talons, then the hobgoblin continues. “Each of us have been wronged. Whether you’ve killed our kind, our family, our livelihood, or even ourselves, the time has come for you to pay the price for your crimes against us.” He gestures to present a bullywug dressed in robes, a shapechanger whose visage flickers from the face of Ardia to that of each of you, a kobold tinkering with a metal device, and a duergar whose eyes flicker with infernal flames. 
> 
> “These representatives have come to witness your doom. Once you are defeated, I shall lead a united Chaos Scar against your precious keep.”
> 
> The first of you reaches the bottom of the ladder. The five Talons tense up. “Enough introductions. Now for the main event.”

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 1: [[Kodan]] K
 - 1: [[Barulg the Returned|Barulg]] B
 - 1: [[Linn]] L
 - 1: [[Primpel]] P
 - 1: [[Slik|Slik]] S

```encounter
name: Rumble in the Valley
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 1: [[Kodan]] 
- 1: [[Barulg the Returned]]
- 1: [[Linn]]
- 1: [[Primpel]]
- 1: [[Slik]]
```

Duragar - 40
Duragar - 20

Remaining creatures should be level 9.

The battle continues until only one group survives. Kodan has staked everything on this showdown, and the other Talons fight on no matter what. Showing weakness in the Chaos Scar is just as bad as losing.

> [!infobox|ws-med]+
> # Consequences of Failure
> If a group failed one or more of the skill challenges presented in [[#Encounter 2 Tunnels of Terror]], its members are affected by a magical disadvantage that hinders their effectiveness during the final confrontation. These effects are summarized below.
> 
> Challenge | Disadvantage |
> ---|---|
> Primpel's Muddy Tomb | Marked by Primpel: Any character who scores a hit against Primpel is weakened until the end of his or her next turn. |
> Linn's Paranoid Gauntlet | Marked by Linn: Any character who scores a hit against Linn cannot regain hit points until the end of his or her next turn. |
> Barulg's Infernal Forge | Marked by Barulg: Any character who scores a hit against Barulg takes 5 fire damage. |
> Slik's Mechanical Nightmare | Marked by Slik: Each character takes –2 penalty to all defenses against Slik’s attacks and has vul- nerable 5 to Slik’s damage.  |

## Tactics
Kodan directs the action, but he also wants to make sure he gets the credit for killing the adventurers. He focuses on bloodied enemies when possible. Linn is fanatically loyal to Kodan and does her best to protect him, seeking combat advantage whenever she can.

Primpel is not afraid to get mixed up in the fight but tries to stay around the periphery and catch as many enemies as possible with his earth-sundering croak. If Kodan dies or is otherwise incapacitated, Primpel attempts to take command of the Talons.

Barulg wants only to prove his power, and he fights to the death.

Slik uses his traps to stay as far away as possible from combat. He uses trick shot and contraptions unleashed to move enemies into melee with the other Talons or into the crowd.

## Features of the Area
**Light:** If the adventurers arrive during the day, the area is brightly lit. At night, torches illuminate the scene with bright light.

**Ledge:** Kodan and his cronies stand on this square chunk of stone, which rises to a height of about 10 feet at its westernmost edge.

**Rope Ladders:** These are secured by metal spikes to the cliff edge in four spots and extend to the valley floor. A creature can attempt a DC 16 Athletics check to climb to a higher position. 

**The Crowd:** This diverse group of Chaos Scar inhabitants can be represented by any monster tokens or miniatures at hand. The creatures are not there to fight but to observe, so they don’t join in the combat. However, any adventurer who gets to close to a crowd member draws a reflexive attack. 

> [!danger]+ Trap
> [[the-crowd-hb|The Crowd]]

# Conclusion 
Defeating all the Talons ends the threat of a unified Chaos Scar and enhances the adventurers’ reputation as heroes. When the last of the Talons is killed, the rest of the crowd quickly scatters to report to their groups that Kodan‘s plan failed. 

If Kodan is killed and his body left unattended, some of the watching monsters spirit it away on the following round. Remove half the remaining creatures in the crowd, and if anyone asks, tell the party that there is no sign of the hobgoblin. (His absence is obvious at the end of the fight.) However, Kodan might return some day to exact revenge.

The adventurers return to the keep, either with a living Ardia (who will eventually recover) or bringing word of hers fate. In either case, they receive a reward of 150 gp, but only returning Ardia alive satisfies the minor quest. If Kodan’s body wasn’t recovered, the adventurers might have to keep an eye out for another scheme from the hobgoblin or his followers.
