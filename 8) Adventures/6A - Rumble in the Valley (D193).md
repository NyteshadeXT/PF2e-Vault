# Background
Kodan is an experienced hobgoblin commander, who leads a band of raiders called the Talons, so named for their hit-and-run tactics patterned after those of certain dragons. Hearing of opportunities for wealth and power, he took his band to the Chaos Scar. 

The Talons’ first mission was to be a simple one: Raid a passing merchant caravan on its way to Restwell Keep. Kodan quickly found that the area was not going to offer the easy pickings he had expected. His band was repelled by a combined force of guards from the keep and the adventurers. As the Talons retreated, though, the group encountered a doppelganger assassin named Linn and a bullywug priest named Primpel, both seeking revenge for the adventurers’ previous meddling. 

The keep and adventuring parties were constant threats that couldn’t be dealt with as long as all the monstrous factions worked on their own. Kodan was struck with an idea: Instead of trying to carve out his own piece of the Chaos Scar, as so many others had done, he could unite all the inhabitants of the Scar under his banner by proving that he was a smart, capable, and powerful leader. To this end, he began to contact representatives of the caves’ inhabitants. Kodan soon encountered others who had experiences similar to his own, and he focused his attention on them. 

Using the talents of various monsters seeking revenge, Kodan took over a set of caves and has turned it into a massive trap. He doesn’t intend to kill the adventurers in the caves but rather weaken them so that he and his now-reinforced Talons can eliminate them, in full view of emissaries from important Chaos Scar factions. With the adventurers out of the way, and having demonstrated his might, Kodan intends to rule the Chaos Scar.
