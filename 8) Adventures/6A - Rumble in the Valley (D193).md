# Background
Kodan is an experienced hobgoblin commander, who leads a band of raiders called the Talons, so named for their hit-and-run tactics patterned after those of certain dragons. Hearing of opportunities for wealth and power, he took his band to the Chaos Scar. 

The Talons’ first mission was to be a simple one: Raid a passing merchant caravan on its way to Restwell Keep. Kodan quickly found that the area was not going to offer the easy pickings he had expected. His band was repelled by a combined force of guards from the keep and the adventurers. As the Talons retreated, though, the group encountered a doppelganger assassin named Linn and a bullywug priest named Primpel, both seeking revenge for the adventurers’ previous meddling. 

The keep and adventuring parties were constant threats that couldn’t be dealt with as long as all the monstrous factions worked on their own. Kodan was struck with an idea: Instead of trying to carve out his own piece of the Chaos Scar, as so many others had done, he could unite all the inhabitants of the Scar under his banner by proving that he was a smart, capable, and powerful leader. To this end, he began to contact representatives of the caves’ inhabitants. Kodan soon encountered others who had experiences similar to his own, and he focused his attention on them. 

Using the talents of various monsters seeking revenge, Kodan took over a set of caves and has turned it into a massive trap. He doesn’t intend to kill the adventurers in the caves but rather weaken them so that he and his now-reinforced Talons can eliminate them, in full view of emissaries from important Chaos Scar factions. With the adventurers out of the way, and having demonstrated his might, Kodan intends to rule the Chaos Scar.

# Adventure Synopsis
The adventurers are summoned by [[Ardia Ironleaf]], a wealthy patron and frequent source of work, about another quest into the Chaos Scar. Ardia explains that elemental creatures are attacking his trade caravans and have been seen coming from a newly spotted cave entrance. She promises wealth and glory, as well as a chance to save innocent lives, if the adventurers investigate the incidents.

In truth, the quest is a ruse. The real Ardia has been captured and replaced by Linn. Kodan has prepared a trap for the adventurers within one of the caves of the Chaos Scar, utilizing the talents of Slik, Primpel, and Barulg.

The adventurers explore the cave, finding it surprisingly easy to navigate. They encounter little trouble until they reach a large chamber containing the wounded body of the true Ardia, guarded by several mud creatures. Entering the chamber triggers a cave-in, blocking the entrance. The only exit is through two sets of tunnels, designed to split the party into two groups and weaken them with traps and hazards to give the Talons the edge in the final battle.

At the end of the tunnels, a small force of sentries loyal to Kodan guard a stone outcropping that looks out over the Chaos Scar valley. The guards have strict orders not to kill the adventurers, but to delay them while Kodan makes final preparations.

In the valley below, witnessed by monstrous emissaries, Kodan and the Talons fight the party in one last showdown. If Kodan defeats the adventurers, he proves his worth to lead the monsters of the Chaos Scar in an attack on Restwell Keep. If he falls, the adventurers end a grave threat to the keep.

# Running the Adventure
- **Caravan Troubles Again:** [[Ardia Ironleaf]] is looking for the party. Something about his caravans being attacked by elemental creatures from the Scar. Sound like she’s willing to pay lots of coin.

# The Adventure Begins
When you’re ready to begin the adventure, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Within the walls of Restwell Keep, you’ve made a name for yourselves as heroes, ready to protect the innocent, rescue the endangered, and thwart the evil. As you walk along the streets, you’re thanked by passersby whom you have helped or those who just know you by reputation.
> 
> So you aren’t surprised to once again be called to another adventure at the behest of Ardia Ironleaf. In the past, she has needed help dealing with the dangers of the Chaos Scar, which are numerous, to clear the way for her trade caravans. Ardia asks you to investigate a possible incursion by elementals that threaten one of his trade routes. As always, she offers to pay well.
> 
> “This should be short work for such experienced adventurers as you,” she says, smiling. Without waiting for your answer, she hands you a map to the spot where she believes the creatures are coming from. She encourages you to leave quickly, for she has another caravan moving through tomorrow.

In fact, the person who the adventurers are meeting with is not [[Ardia Ironleaf]], but the doppelganger Linn, who has replaced the merchant to lure the party into Kodan’s trap. She doesn’t have the information to answer many questions the adventurers might pose. If pressed, ”Ardia” claims that her scouts provided the tip and are back out on patrol.

This excuse might make the adventurers suspicious. With a successful DC 29 [[sense-motive|Sense Motive]] check, a character senses that Ardia seems to be upset about something. If challenged, she explains that she is annoyed at the cost of doing business in the keep. (In reality, the doppelganger wants revenge for the death of her brothers.) If the adventurers continue to press her, she excuses herself on the pretext that she has another important meeting to attend.

The fake Ardia pays the party 85 gp up front, with a promise of triple that on successful completion of the mission. If that doesn’t persuade the adventurers, the doppelganger increases the offer as needed—she intends for them never to return, so payment isn’t a problem.

The map provided by "Ardia" is detailed and accurate, leading the party right to the cave entrance. The journey is surprisingly quiet for a trip into the Chaos Scar—the first clue that something is not quite right about the mission.

If the characters manage to discover that Arida is a fake, the doppelganger is willing to reveal what she knows of Kodan’s plan. Linn tells the group that Kodan has gained the allegiance of a number of Chaos Scar creatures and seeks to prove his worth by defeating the party. She pleads for her life and tells them that unless they go to the cave, the real Ardia will be killed. If they spare her, she betrays them at the first opportunity.

## Entering the Cave
The cave immediately begins to slope downward, twisting to the east. With a successful DC 26 [[skills#nature|Nature]] check, a character notices that the caves aren’t entirely natural: Someone has recently done work to improve them.

If the adventurers take time to search more thoroughly, or decide to turn back, you can encourage them to continue forward with the sound of an anguished cry from ahead: the voice of the real Ardia.

## Encounter 1: Between Rust and a Hard Place
![[6A - Rumble in the Valley (D193)-20240820111648698.webp]]

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 2: [[BadGuy1]] W
 - 2: [[BadGuy2]] H

```encounter
name: EncounterName
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 2: [[Badguy1]] 
- 2: [[Badguy2]]
```

The map for Event 1 shows the entrance and the  cavern where Ardia is being held. She is badly injured and needs attention if she is to survive. Once the adventurers enter the cave, the tunnel leading back out starts to collapse.

Monsters: 2 elemental evil mudborn (M), 1 gelatinous
cube (G), 2 gluttonous rust monsters (R).

When the adventurers get close enough to see inside, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> You stand at the entrance to a large chamber, divided into two sections. The more distant half is illuminated by torches on the walls, placed to give you a good view of a sight you were clearly intended to witness. 
> 
> Your patron Dyson—battered, beaten, and bloody— hangs pitifully from manacles attached by chains to the far wall. There’s no way the old man could have arrived before you, and his wounds show that he has suffered long-term abuse.
> 
> Surrounding him are two humanoid shapes seemingly made of living mud. Within their chests, covered by the muck, are two wriggling insect-like creatures, whose antennae occasionally poke out of the disgusting slime. 
> 
> Dyson tries to choke out a warning, but the pain of his injuries, reinforced by a brutal blow from one of the mud creatures, silences him before he can finish. The monsters emit a low gurgling sound as they turn to face you, and the cat-sized insects burst forth, leaving a bubbling mud trail behind them. 
> 
> Behind you, a loud crashing sound reverberates through the tunnels.

At the start of the first round of combat, the adventurers hear a loud rumbling: the beginning of a cave-in. On the second round, the entrance tunnel fills with rubble. On the third round, rubble spills out into the cavern, pushing anyone in it into the far chamber. (The rubble-strewn area is difficult terrain.)

Any creature that tries to escape back through the entrance tunnel on the first round gets caught in the falling rock, taking `dice: 6d10+15` damage. The creature is immobilized and takes ongoing 10 damage until it escapes. The creature can make a saving throw to avoid the collapse, taking half damage on a save. A trapped creature can try to escape once per round, and escaping requires a DC 29 Athletics check.

After the cave-in ends, returning through the entrance passage is no longer possible. The only exit is the tunnel at the far side of the cavern.

### Tactics
The elemental evil mudborn are under
orders to stop enemies from reaching Dyson. They
stay near him, launching their mud ball attacks at
anyone who tries to approach. The gluttonous rust
monsters were imprisoned within the mudborn,
where they starved nearly to death. They home in on
the character with the most metal to devour.
The gelatinous cube was prodded into place to
prevent an early exit. It spends the first round moving
into better position to engulf prey. It avoids the mudborn
(which have no flesh to devour) but does not
hesitate to overrun a rust monster while trying to get
to a character.

### Features of the Area
Light: Torches along the walls of the farther
cavern shed bright light.
Dyson (D): The old man has been tortured and
will die in a few rounds if he is not tended to. Anyone
adjacent to him can make a DC 15 Heal check to
stabilize him. Using a healing power on Dyson automatically
stabilize him. Otherwise, he makes a death
saving throw at the end of each round and dies after
three failures. Even if stabilized, Dyson barely clings
to life and is unconscious for the remainder of the
adventure. Rescuing Dyson fulfills a minor quest.

QUEST: Caver n Rescue
7th-Level Minor Quest (300 XP)
Returning Dyson to town alive earns the characters
the quest reward.
