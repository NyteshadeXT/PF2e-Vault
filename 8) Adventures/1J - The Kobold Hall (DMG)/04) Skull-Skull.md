As the adventurers enter this chamber, read:

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> This chamber looks like it was once a tomb, but the kobolds have transformed it into what you might almost call a playground. Four stone coffins lie here, with a sludge-filled pit between them. On the opposite end of the room is a wooden double door. Flanking the double door are two raised platforms, both 10 feet above the floor. A kobold stand on each platform. Arrayed on the coffins are several animal skulls, all of them arranged in small piles. One kobold holds a sludge-drenched stone tied to a long rope that is secured in the ceiling.

#### Skull-Skull Stone Level 1
**Complexity** Simple  
**Description** This sludge-covered stone is tied to a long rope that hangs from a hook in the ceiling.

---
**Disable**  A character in the marked area can ready an action to attack the rope (AC 14, 10 hp, and resist 5 to all damage).  Alternately, a character can make ranged attacks against the rope.

**HP** 10 (BT 5); **Immunities** critical hits, object immunities, precision damage

### Tactics

The kobolds try to batter the PCs into submission while avoiding melee.

The kobold warriors split up, one on each platform. They take turns activating the skull-skull trap, one throwing a javelin on a turn when it isn’t activating the trap. 

The kobold scouts fire at the PCs, hoping to use their shots to harass characters and make them easier targets for the rock.

The kobolds’ pet shadow drake remains on the other side of the door. It russhes up the stairs to attack a PC who climbs up to the platforms. Otherwise, it attacks anyone who breaches the door.

### Features of the Area

**Pit:** The pit is 10 feet deep, filled up to a depth of 4 feet with a thick green sludge. The sludge has two important traits. First, it is sticky. Any character who falls into the pit is immobilized. A DC 13 [[skills#Athletics]]  check allows a PC to break free. The sludge is difficult terrain. Creatures can walk in it, but a creature that ends its move in the sludge is immobilized as described above. Climbing out of the pit requires a DC 10 [[skills#Acrobatics]] check. A creature that falls in takes `dice: 1d10-2` damage, since the sludge provides cushion against a fall.

**Door:** The door has 20 hit points. Bashing it down requires a DC 16 [[skills#Athletics]] check.

**Skull-Skull Stone:** This weird device counts as a trap. The kobolds normally swing it down to hit a skull on the coffins below. The object of the game is to get a skull to stick to the rock, and then grab the skull as it comes back to the thrower. When the PCs arrive on the scene, the kobolds are happy to use the rock against them.

**Platforms:** There are no railings for the raised platforms. Climbing the wall up to the platform from the floor requires a DC 13 [[skills#Athletics]] check. Scattered on the floor in a small pile in the northern platform are 10 gp in coins, an agate and two obsidian worth 5 sp each.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> In addition to any weapons and armor the kobolds carry a total 7 gp a formula (3) and Choker-Arm Mutagen (Moderate).
