As the adventurers enter this chamber, read:

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The room ahead has four stone coffins, all of which show signs of vandalism and abuse. To the left is a series of six niches, set apart into two groups of three. Two more niches along the walls each hold a suit of armor. On the opposite end of the room is a raised section of floor with a makeshift altar set atop it. Three kobolds carrying spears stand in front of the alter.

### Tactics

The kobolds attempt to use the traps to their advantage. They try to lure characters into chasing them across the room, taking advantage of the fact that creatures of Small size are too light to trigger the trap.

### Features of the Area

**Coffins:** The stone coffins are difficult terrain that provide cover.

**Armor:** These two suits of plate armor stand at attention. When the dart traps activate, their helmet visors swing open to reveal a dart-firing mechanism.

**Trigger Points:** Several squares on the map are marked with the number 1 or 2. The 1s correspond to squares that trigger dart trap 1. The same applies to trap 2. The two suits of armor are likewise marked 1 and 2 to indicate the location of each trap’s firing mechanism.

**Altar:** The kobolds have lovingly crafted this crude altar to Tiamat. A small bag on the altar holds 6 gp, an offering.

#### Dart Trap

**Stealth** DC 20 (trained) The character notices the firing mechanisms in the armor visors.
