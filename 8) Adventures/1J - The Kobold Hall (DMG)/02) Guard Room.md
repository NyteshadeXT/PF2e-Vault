As the adventurers enter this chamber, read:

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Dominating the room ahead is a long trench filled with a glowing green substance. Beyond the trench, a small,  reptilian humanoid stands in a shadowy chamber, gaping at you. It carries a sling, and quickly reaches into a pouch at its belt for a stone. It hisses and shouts, “Intrudersss! Intrudersss!”

### Tactics

One of the kobold warriors attempts to lure the PCs into the room, where the others hide. The scouts fires at the PCs, while the other two warriors split up to circle around the pit and attack. Meanwhile, the kobolds behind the portcullis wait until the PCs are in sight of their position. Once the PCs have moved up, they attack. The kobolds are alert to area attacks. They never cluster together unless tey can gain flanking attacks

### Features of the Area

**Pit:** The pit is 10 feet deep, filled up to 4 feet with a thick, green sludge. Any PC who falls into the pit is immobilized. A DC 13 Athletics check allows a PC to break free. The sludge is difficult terrain. Creatures can walk in it, but a creature that ends its move in the sludge is immobilized as described above. Climbing out of the pit requires a DC 13 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]]  check. A creature that falls in takes `dice: 1d10-2` damage, since the sludge provides cushion against a fall.

**Portcullis:** The passage to the east has a portcullis designed to bar larger creatures. Small creatures ignore it, but it stops larger folk. Forcing the portcullis up requires a DC 12 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check. The lever to open it is down the hall from the portcullis.
