The ruined manor now known as Kobold Hall was once a minor lord’s proud holding, a walled keep over looking the old King’s Road. That was years ago, and the lord’s name and the glories he earned are long forgotten. Today, the place is called Kobold Hall after the malicious humanoids that infest the place. The Cloak Wood has overrun the grounds, with trees growing in the midst of abandoned gardens and courtyards. 

Several kobold tribes dwell within the ruins, hiding in the multitude of tunnels, ruins, and cellars found here. The tribes squabble with each other, raid surrounding settlements, and attack caravans on the old King’s Road. Lately, the kobolds have become more aggressive. The Skull Kicker tribe has taken over or driven off the rival tribes. Emboldened, the Skull Kickers stole a wagon loaded with valuable cargo from a caravan on the King’s Road. As the adventure begins, the characters find themselves at Restwell Keep. 

Use one of the hooks below to set up the backstory for the adventurers, or create your own. You don’t need a lot of details; you just need enough to explain why the PCs are together and why they are heading out to investigate Kobold Hall.
