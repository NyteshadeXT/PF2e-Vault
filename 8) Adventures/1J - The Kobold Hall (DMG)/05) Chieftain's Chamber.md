### Tactics

The kobolds prefer to let their boulder crush the PCs. They keep to the sides of the chamber, firing at the characters. The ranged kobolds climb ladders in the interior chamber to stand atop the interior walls and fire. The chieftain (the wyrmpriest) and the two dragonshields remain on the platform. If a PC comes close to the platform, the dragonshields rush forward to attack. The chieftain uses his +1 staff of the war mage to increase the area of his dragon breath attack.

### Features of the Area

**Central Room:** The wall here is 10 feet tall, and the ceiling in this chamber is 20 feet above the floor. PCs and kobolds can climb over the wall to reach the central chamber. Climbing requires a DC 13 [[skill#Athletics]] check. The wall is wide enough to allow a creature to stand on top of it.

**Door:** The door to the central room has 20 hit points. Bashing it down requires a DC 14 [[skill#Athletics]] check.

**Boulder:** Full stats for the trap are given above. It starts at the point marked on the map and follows the path.

**Platform:** There are no railings on the raised platforms. Climbing up the side of the platform requires a DC 13  [[skill#Athletics]] check. The platform is 10 feet up.

### Ending the Encounter
When the characters defeat the kobolds, they find a small silver key in the chief ’s belt pouch, along with a piece of parchment that describes the location of a secret door in the alcove to the north. The key opens the door, revealing a secret set of stairs leading down to the final encounter area.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> The kobold chieftain carries 10 gp and 8 sp as well as a Ghost Charge.
