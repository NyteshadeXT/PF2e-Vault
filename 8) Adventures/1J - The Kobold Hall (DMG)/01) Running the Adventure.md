# Adventure Hooks

**Dragon Hide**
The player characters are hired by Bergen the Smith. Among the cargo of a stolen merchants wagon was a cured green dragon hide destined for his shop. Bergen intends to turn the hide into a fine suit of scale armor. He hires the adventurers to enter the kobold lair and get back his dragon hide. If they succeed, he gives them 200 gp.

Alternative: The PCs hear about the loss of the wagon and the dragon hide and approach Bergen to see if there’s a reward for its return.

**Kobold Bounty**
The Kendon Longstrider has had enough of Fireclaw clan kobold raids along the old King’s Road. If the PCs approach him looking for work, he readily offers them a bounty for clearing out Kobold Hall. The Baliff promises a bounty of 10 gp for each dispatched kobold and an additional 100 gp if the PCs bring proof that the ruins have been cleared out, such as the bone mask worn by the kobold leader.

Alternative: The Baliff specifically seeks out the PCs to ask them to undertake this mission.
