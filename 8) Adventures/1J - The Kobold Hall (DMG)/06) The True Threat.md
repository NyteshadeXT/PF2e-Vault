This chamber is the lair of the young white dragon Szartharrax. Although he is still small by the standards of his kind, Szartharrax is far and away the most dangerous monster in Kobold Hall. He is the reason the Fireclaw's managed to assert themselves over the other kobold gangs in the area; Szartharrax decided to back them and ate the rival chieftains, which persuaded the rest of the scaly little monsters to swear allegiance to the Fireclaw's. Szartharrax has an appetite for gold, and the white dragon has been demanding tribute from his loyal servants. Fear of the dragon’s anger is driving the kobolds to attack caravans and launch raids against the nearby settlements.

Szartharrax is a tough opponent; the adventurers will have to fight well to survive. This encounter includes the following creature.

As the adventurers enter this chamber, read:

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> You follow a long, winding passage from the kobold chieftain’s throne room down and down into the earth. Eventually, the finely worked stone tunnels give way to natural passages. Finally, you come upon a large cavern. The air is unnaturally cold in here. In the center of the room is a large pool of frozen dark water. The cavern is quiet.

### Tactics

The dragon begins the encounter hiding in the area marked on the map. Make a [[skills#Stealth]] check for the dragon opposed by the player characters’ passive [[skills#Perception]] checks. Player characters whose Perception checks are lower than the dragon’s Stealth check are surprised. Roll initiative and begin the combat. The dragon starts by flying to a spot just in front of the party and using his icy breath against as many player characters as he can catch in the area at one time. In subsequent rounds, the dragon tears the adventurers apart with his multiattack.

Szartharrax avoids heavily armored characters, preferring instead to pick off lightly armored foes. If the dragon becomes bloodied, he goes into a rage. He attacks the nearest PC, ignoring any intelligent tactics in favor of brute force.

### Features of the Area

**Pool:** The pool of water is 2 feet deep and frozen solid. The ice is difficult terrain, but the dragon ignores it if it walks through it (thanks to its ice walk ability).

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> If the PCs manage to slay the dragon, they find a small cave up ahead that has a locked treasure chest (DC 20 [[skills#Thievery|Thievery]] check to open). The chest contains the piece of dragon hide that Bergen wanted recovered, 24 gp in a small felt bag a Rime Crystal and a Sturdy Shield (Minor).
