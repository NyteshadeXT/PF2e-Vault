# Background
Trained in the art of rune smithing by devotees of Moradin, the dwarf runepriest Olek Dael grew frustrated by the slow expansion or, at times, the contraction of dwarven civilization. Stymied by opposition at every turn, the votary had what he considered an epiphany: Force employed in service of order and light was far better than rampant chaos and darkness. If people would not listen to reason and work together, civilization must be imposed on them. The god of conquest, Hextor, offered exactly what Olek so desperately sought. 

From his training, the fanatic knew about the ancient runes used in the War of Supremacy. Although the laws of rune smithing expressly forbade taking advantage of such tools, the dwarf was convinced that he was strong enough to command them. Using the runes, Olek would call down an avatar of Hextor to lead an army dedicated to order. 

Casting about for a location to stage his triumph, Olek settled on the Chaos Scar. The meteor was a clear sign from Hextor and a monument to his divine power. The lawlessness of the area made it the perfect spot to engrave his runes and conduct his rituals devoted to order. With the avatar by his side, the various, warring creatures already present at the Scar would make an unstoppable army. 

As a first step, Olek joined the Brotherhood of the Scar, finding willing allies in that evil cult. The runepriest began using the ancient runes regularly, believing that he was binding his allies into a cohesive unit. He rose through the ranks, bringing prominent lieutenants under his command. 

Unknown to Olek, the runes are part of a warding mechanism that keeps a number of primordials trapped in a prison of dreams. The runic words hold great power, but using them drains that power and weakens the ensnaring thought-construct. 

Olek’s careful plans and monomaniacal focus have borne fruit. His magical might approaches an apex, just as the first primordial begins to tear through the walls of the divine prison.

# Running the Adventure
**An Old Friend (See [[Restwell Jobs#Events]])** [[Lord Drysdale]], paladin of Waukeen and ruler of Restwell Keep, knew Olek Dael before the dwarf deserted Moradin to worship Hextor. Tales of his former ally’s fall from grace reached the paladin, and he feels responsible for stopping Olek. Unable to see to the task himself, Drysdale seeks adventurers well versed in religion and capable of tracking down the dwarf.  If the adventurers bring back Olek Dael alive Drysdale offers a reward of 2,000 gp.  However he's is willing to go to 2,500 gp to see his friend alive.

## The Forbidden Runes
Each of Olek’s lieutenants received a rune for serving the runepriest faithfully. Both a blessing and a curse, each rune provides supernatural powers but costs its bearer dearly.

The runes have a life of their own—more an instinctual compulsion than true sentience. When a rune’s owner dies, the mark passes to a nearby creature that it can “help.” The rune jumps from host to host like a disease, granting power as it does so.

Olek and his lieutenants in this adventure, Ptolema and Jorag, possess runes. Each rune’s boon and curse are included in their stat blocks. The runebound creature gains both the curse and the boon.

When the runebound creature dies, the rune appears on the arm of a nearby creature, searing the flesh in a specific pattern. The deceased former host turns into a water elemental (Monster Manual 3, page 83). The elemental is conscious, has full hit points, and is controlled by the DM. A character who dies as an elemental can be raised from the dead in his or her original form.

**Removing the Runes:** [[remove-disease|Remove Disease]] and other methods of removing ill effects cannot overcome the power of the ancient runes. Only one certain method of removing the runes exist: Upon the defeat of the primordial Hoshotath (see encounter 3: The Shattered Prison), the runes dissipate from their hosts.

Rune of Poison (Ptolema)
Rune of Poison’s Curse: If the runebound creature moves more than 4 squares on its turn, it becomes weakened until the end of its next turn.

## Hoshotath, The Flaming Sea
Among the most volatile of the Primordials to walk Aetheria was Hoshotath, a colossal entity born of both fire and water—an elemental paradox whose very existence defied stability. Known as the Flaming Sea, Hoshotath embodied contradiction: at times tranquil and meditative like a still lake, and at others uncontrollably violent, crashing like a tidal wave or burning with unquenchable flame.

In the time before the War of Supremacy, Hoshotath roamed the world freely, its movements altering coastlines, boiling oceans, and igniting the skies. While some of the elder gods and Primordials could occasionally parley with it during moments of clarity, more often Hoshotath was a harbinger of catastrophe—its rages drowning cities in steam and ash. 

Fearing its destructive power, a coalition of elemental titans formed to monitor and restrain the Flaming Sea. For a time, their combined might kept it in check. But with the outbreak of the Axis War, and the emergence of the Primordial Chaos, order among the Primordials dissolved. Hoshotath was unleashed in full fury. During that calamitous era, Hoshotath sought to unmake the world's oceans—transforming them into vast seas of lava that would scour both land and sky. The gods acted swiftly. In a desperate defense, two divine beings gave their lives to quell the disaster, their essences boiling away in an effort to hold back the tidal fire.

In the aftermath, the surviving gods pooled their remaining divine energies and worked in secret with the Aetherial Wardens. Together, they crafted a network of immense runes—binding glyphs inscribed with pure law, anchored to the ley lines of the world. These glyphs were not mere magical wards, but self-sustaining thought-constructs designed to fold Hoshotath's chaotic mind inward—trapping the entity within its own conflicting nature. The resulting prison was strong enough to not only contain Hoshotath, but also ensnare several lesser Primordials drawn into its gravitational collapse. This containment—a miracle of divine sacrifice and Warden precision—holds to this day. But it is not eternal.

The gods, weakened by their efforts, declared the use of such runes forbidden. Their creation had nearly undone the Veil that now separates the divine from the mortal realm. The location of Hoshotath’s prison remains hidden, its sigils fading only slowly. But should the Axis tilt again toward chaos the Flaming Sea may boil forth once more.

## The Runic Library
After the adventurers get wind of Olek’s plans, they must locate his sanctum—a runic library hidden in a small dungeon he cleared out nearly a decade ago. Although Olek calls the place his library, the adventurers won’t find books or scrolls there. Instead, runes cover the floors and walls. Most of the marks are reference points, lacking a few touches that would make them active. The place is described in more detail in encounter 2: The Runic Library.

When the characters arrive near the library, they find Olek’s lieutenant Ptolema standing guard on the earthen cliff near the entrance. The fight against her is presented in encounter 1: grove of Statues. If she’s defeated, the adventurers can descend the stairs to find Jorag, another of Olek’s lieutenants. They face him and the wards within the sanctum in encounter 2: The Runic Library.

## Olek’s Trail
After defeating his champions, the adventurers discover that Olek isn’t at the runic library. Either by rummaging through his papers or by interrogating his lieutenants, the heroes can learn the runepriest’s whereabouts.

**Olek’s Papers:** In a side room of the library behind a locked door (Thievery DC 31 to open), the runepriest’s papers lie scattered across a long wooden table. Each of the sketches directly in front of the chair features a diagram of a set of standing stones, with a series of runes written beside the stones. Several versions are stacked in a pile, each with some sections scribbled out, suggesting that Olek was unsatisfied with it. A small map, drawn crudely by someone other than the creator of the diagrams, shows the area near the runic library and a path that leads to a hill to the west. The map depicts the same circle of standing stones as the diagrams.

**Interrogation:** Ptolema and Jorag initially refuse to give out any information. A hefty bribe or a promise of freedom backed by a convincing threat persuades one of the two lieutenants to part with information on Olek’s whereabouts. Both subordinates know that Olek headed west with his rune-smithing tools and camping supplies. Beyond that, they are not privy to the details of his plan. He has been heading off to the west to work repeatedly over the last few weeks, but has kept quiet about where he’s going. If the adventurers pursue to the west, a DC 32 Perception check allows them to track Olek’s movements.

## The Runic Stones
The trip to the hill where Olek works consumes hours. As they journey they see threatening, unnatural clouds ahead of them. This swirling miasma indicates that Olek has almost completed his nefarious activities. If the party rests, he’ll finish it with time to spare!

As the adventurers come within sight of the hill the stones stand on, they see strange, blue-tinged storm clouds gathering. They flash with red-orange sheet lightning. At odd moments, when the lighting is just right, the clouds take on a vaguely humanoid shape, reaching down toward the hill ahead.

Upon the hill, Olek chants divine words of power. When the adventurers ascend the hill, read the text at the start of encounter 3: The Shattered Prison. If they take a measured approach and try to talk to Olek, consult the “Parley with Olek” sidebar.

## Conclusion
If the adventurers defeat Olek without killing him, they can take him to an authority such as Lord Drysdale for imprisonment or deal with him on their own terms. The runepriest’s defeat does not change his goals, however. If the adventurers let him go, he’s likely to turn up again with more power and a more baleful plan.
