# Background
Trained in the art of rune smithing by devotees of Erathis, the dwarf runepriest Olek Dael grew frustrated by the slow expansion or, at times, the contraction of civilization. Stymied by opposition at every turn, the votary had what he considered an epiphany: Force employed in service of order and light was far better than rampant chaos and darkness. If people would not listen to reason and work together, civilization must be imposed on them. The god of conquest, Bane, offered exactly what Olek so desperately sought. 

From his training, the fanatic knew about the ancient runes used in the Dawn War. Although the laws of rune smithing expressly forbade taking advantage of such tools, the dwarf was convinced that he was strong enough to command them. Using the runes, Olek would call down an avatar of Bane to lead an army dedicated to order. 

Casting about for a location to stage his triumph, Olek settled on the Chaos Scar. The meteor was a clear sign from Bane and a monument to his divine power. The lawlessness of the area made it the perfect spot to engrave his runes and conduct his rituals devoted to order. With the avatar by his side, the various, warring creatures already present at the Scar would make an unstoppable army. 

As a first step, Olek joined the Brotherhood of the Scar, finding willing allies in that evil cult. The runepriest began using the ancient runes regularly, believing that he was binding his allies into a cohesive unit. He rose through the ranks, bringing prominent lieutenants under his command. 

Unknown to Olek, the runes are part of a warding mechanism that keeps a number of primordials trapped in a prison of dreams. The runic words hold great power, but using them drains that power and weakens the ensnaring thought-construct. 

Olekâ€™s careful plans and monomaniacal focus have borne fruit. His magical might approaches an apex, just as the first primordial begins to tear through the walls of the divine prison.
