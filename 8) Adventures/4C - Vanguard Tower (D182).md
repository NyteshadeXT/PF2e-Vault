# Background
Many adventurers come to the Chaos Scar looking for lost treasure, powerful magic, and vicious monsters to defeat. The Scar has all three in copious amounts, and some seek to make a profit by turning a negative (captured creatures such as rust monsters or the last known location of a missing band of would-be heroes) into a positive—for them if nobody else. The beholder gauth named Shur-Tuuz is one such profiteer, and its recent efforts have seen it lead a group of duergar to the tower, where it also hopes to profit by selling a couple of rust monsters to a band of local gnolls. The beholder already has the duergars’ payment for the information; now it seeks to gain payment for the rust monsters. 

After the beholder arrived at the location with the band of duergar, they all discovered that the tower hadn’t had inhabitants for a few months. Seeing another opportunity, Shur-Tuuz sent its runner off to the gnolls, but also sent another back to one of its usual haunts to gather more forces. It wants to keep the tower as another base of operations. Thus far, Shur-Tuuz has succeeded at its endeavors to sell information and various “found” goods, and this tower could serve as a useful location for it. Storing vicious creatures in some of its bases is not convenient; this place, however, is far enough out that it can consider selling more dangerous creatures than rust monsters. 

Unfortunately for Shur-Tuuz, a local druid saw its band heading toward the tower, plus the rust monsters, and she quickly made it known to contacts that something was going on at the tower. How this news reaches the ears of the adventurers is up to the DM (see some hooks below for ideas), but the druid and other folk are not happy with the idea of having a beholder in that tower, and they don’t appreciate the presence of rust monsters in the area. The heroes might also know the former inhabitants of the tower and seek to discover what happened to them. Whatever the case, they arrive as the negotiations for the rust monsters are taking place.

# Adventure Hooks
**Not Rust Monsters!:** A druid who lives in the area of the tower saw the rust monsters being taken to the tower by the beholder. She made this information known to friends of hers in various towns, and one of these friends approaches the heroes. He or she wants to alleviate the concerns the druid has about the rust monsters. Perhaps the druid finished handling a rust monster menace elsewhere and wishes to prevent this from happening again—but the beholder and its duergar entourage are beyond her ability to handle.

**Shur-Tuuz Must Pay:** While staying at the Stumbling Giant for a night Vatoris is targeted by assassins. The heroes tracked down the source of the betrayal to Shur-Tuuz. The beholder has learned of the players efforts to cleanse the Scar and seeks to eliminate them before they become a problem for him. Of course, if Shur-Tuuz were eliminated, the heroes would take one step closer to victory.

# Running the Adventure

The Tower
Formerly the base for the Cats of Thleen, the tower is
being used for different purposes now. Both the original
purpose and the current condition of each floor
are described below to allow DMs to use the tower
for more than the adventure at hand. See “Using Vanguard
Tower as a Hook” for more information on the
tower’s backstory.
Top Floor (An Interrupted Negotiation): Artemeque
Labruinn, the leader of the Cats of Thleen,
came to the Chaos Scar, realizing its potential as a
base of operations. He reserved the top floor for himself
as a library, where he would carefully plan the
Cats’ next big heist. Over the years, he has collected
information about the Scar and those interested in it.
Someday, he hopes that selling this collection of lore
will allow him to retire. Currently the room is the
location where the gnoll and beholder are meeting to
make the exchange.
Middle Floor (Snake Charmers): Zagira, a
dragonborn mystic, accompanied Artemeque to the
area. The mystic spends most of her time studying the
meteor, because she seeks to harness its power. Zagira
took over the middle floor of the tower, though she is
rarely there. Instead, she wanders the Scar seeking
out the strange interaction between the metal and
arcane energy. When she first arrived, she turned
her floor into a series of interconnected teleportation
wards to allow the Cats to teleport to any one of their
