# Background
The human wizard named Bolios Whittish commands a strange flying fortress carved from the head of an enormous statue and fortified with a crownlike tower. The Head in the Clouds serves as Bolios’s home and means of travel. Bolios has dedicated his life to the study of elemental spirits and the Elemental Chaos. He discovered the head in his quest for knowledge and christened it The Head in the Clouds. 

Bolios found the massive head (possibly from an immense statue) floating above a desert near a weak point in the border between planes. He discovered that the stone was imbued with elemental spirits that made it weightless. With the aid of some desert-dwelling dwarves, Bolios strengthened the bonds on the beings and built towers atop it, creating a flying fortress (which he insists on calling his “ship”) from which he could explore the world. 

After hearing about the Chaos Scar, Bolios traveled to the area in the hope of learning more about it. For a few days he made distant observations from high in the clouds. Recently, he realized that his tower is sinking and being pulled farther into the Scar. Well aware of the possible danger, Bolios has been trying to discover the cause of the pull and fight against it. By the time he drifts down out of the clouds and spots the heroes, Bolios is desperate. 

If you’d like to give the adventure a longer build-up, let the characters notice something ominous in the sky. It’s just a speck at first, but eventually it draws close enough that they can recognize it as something that doesn’t belong in the sky. Depending on how much lead time you have and how much mystery you want to build around it, this might take a few hours, a few days, or even a week or more. Allowing the characters to see the head as nothing more than a smudge against the distant clouds for several days should spark their curiosity. 

When the distant object is first spotted, there will be no reliable information on it but plenty of conjecture. If the characters are in a town or settlement of any size, such as Restwell Keep, this will be the number one topic of conversation. Once the citadel’s shape becomes recognizable, the suppositions will only increase. Some people will hail it as a sign from the gods, others as a sign from devils; some will consider it a good omen, others a sure signal that the apocalypse is near. Those who favor more mundane explanations probably assume that it’s the home of flying raiders coming to attack and loot the village. All sorts of plans and proposals will be put forward ranging from scattering and hiding in the hills to imploring the spirits of the sky for intercession to organizing a scouting/diplomatic party to get a closer look. If the latter happens, the characters should be included in (or at least invited to join) the official contingent sent to investigate the intruder. If the characters are the ones to make this suggestion, so much the better.

# Running the Adventure
While the heroes are traveling or camped in the Chaos Scar, a howling wind kicks up all around and persists for a day. At some point during the day, they receive a strange greeting.
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The strange weather suddenly worsens, and heavy hail slams painfully into your heads and shoulders. It takes a moment to realize it, but the “hail” rings loudly off your gear and golden circles pelt the ground around you. Dozens of gold coins are falling from the sky! When you look up, you see their source.
> 
> An enormous stone head drifts through the air about 200 feet above you. As you watch, it sinks slightly lower, and you see that a fortified tower has been built upon its top like a crown. An elderly human man is leaning out of the head’s gaping mouth and waving to you. He seems to be shouting something, but it’s hard to hear him over the howling wind.

You can make Bolios as difficult or as easy to hear as you like. Bolios hopes to communicate his need for help to the characters. He doesn’t know who they are, but they’re bound to be better than the minotaurs he can see from his high vantage. He hopes the adventurers have some means of helping him stop his ship, and he’s willing to offer wealth (beyond the 78 gp he threw to the ground) and magic if the characters help him retain his flying home.

Bolios can’t control his ship, but he’ll do what he can to get the characters aboard. Unfortunately, that amounts to tying off a 50-foot length of rope and throwing it down. if the heroes board his ship, he eagerly greets them and shows them to the magic circles he hopes to use to arrest The Head in the Clouds. If they can’t get aboard, Bolios begs them to follow him and heads inside to work on the circles. either way, the work on the magic circles causes the minotaur's’ ritual to fail and the floating head to crash, dragging its neck across the ground for several hundred feet before it finally stops.

## Bolios Whittsh

[[Bolios Wittish.webp|Show to Players]]
![[Bolios Wittish.webp|left|500]]

Bolios Whittish is a rotund man of about 60 with white hair and a ruddy face in need of a shave. Bolios is outgoing, but unless the topic of conversation aligns with his interests (elemental magic, elemental creatures, the elemental Chaos, or his ship, The Head in the Clouds) he swiftly becomes distracted by his own thoughts and activities.

Bolios came to the Chaos Scar to observe what elemental creatures live there and to see if he might find evidence that the evil that created the Scar has an elemental origin. He can’t think of what life would be like without The Head in the Clouds, so he’s not willing to give it up unless he has no hope of saving it.

Bolios will agree to grant the heroes a reward if they ask for it, and he gives it freely if they don’t. See “Treasure” for a description of what Bolios can offer and what the heroes might claim if Bolios is dead.

Use Bolios to aid the characters in battle. The encounters in this adventure assume his inclusion, so if you decide not to use Bolios, the encounters are more difficult.

The encounters in this adventure can be run in many ways. How you organize the encounters depends on the actions of the characters.

## Running the Encounters
During the opening scene, the characters might find a way to board The Head in the Clouds. if so, they meet Bolios and can see the magic circles that power his vessel. in this case, the adventurers’ efforts to slow the ship unravel the circles and crash the ship (causing 2d10 damage and knocking the characters prone). encounter 2 then starts as the elementals break free, followed by the ettins arriving for encounter 1, and finally the minotaurs arrive for encounter 3.

If the characters can’t make it up to The Head in the Clouds, they won’t be able to keep up with it as it is blown over some very broken terrain of the Scar. Instead, when they arrive at the crash site, the ettins are already on the scene, provoking encounter 1. While dealing with them, the characters can hear Bolios chanting (he’s trying to contain the elemental beings). The characters can thereafter enter the enormous head and help Bolios deal with the escaped elementals in encounter 2. The minotaurs arrive soon after for encounter 3.

Whichever way you run the encounters, consider allowing one encounter to run up into the next with no break available to the characters. These encounters will be more fun if the players need to manage threats coming hard on their heels from different directions. If things aren’t going well, you can delay an encounter to allow a the players a chance to heal and recovery somewhat. Perhaps Bolios rummages among his things and finds a scroll that raises a temporary wall of ice to block the monsters and give the group a respite. it’s up to you— but the more frantic the pace, the better.

# The Head in The Clouds
The Head in the Clouds is crafted from the massive severed head of a statue with a crownlike tower built atop it. The head is about 100 feet tall from its chin to its top and 80 feet wide (slightly larger than George Washington’s head in Mount Rushmore or roughly five times the size of the head of the Statue of liberty). in addition to this, the head wears a “crown”—a fortified tower of two levels, each about 15 feet tall. The head looks like an angry, bearded human face, but the artistic license taken with the shapes could mean it was meant to depict an individual of another race or even some godlike or primordial being.

![[7C - Head in the Clouds _D184_-1745417018211.webp]]

**The Head:** The face of the statue has openings for the mouth, eyes, and nostrils. The mouth opens into a “cave” carved out of the interior of the head. This cave has a source of water in it that remains forever full (at least until the elemental creatures escape in encounter 2). The cave also contains a set of rough stairs that steeply round the back of the interior of the head until they reach the second cave level.

![[7C - Head in the Clouds _D184_-1745417033664.webp]]

The second cave chamber in the head is at the level of the eyes, roughly 50 feet above the lower chamber. Near the stairs, the dwarves broke through the wall and built a stairwell to gain entrance to the tower above it. Someone in this level of the head can look out of the eye holes, but only a creature of Small or smaller size can squeeze through them. Small holes are also in the wall below the eyes and are narrow channels leading to the nostrils. A blackened spot on the floor sheltered by a fire-darkened overhang is between the nostril channel holes. The charred floor shows the position where a fire could be built to force smoke out through the nostrils. in one corner of the chamber, rusted chains are attached to the wall. in its distant past, the chains kept creatures in place so that the statue could weep warm blood from its eyes.

**The Tower:** Bolios’s tower consists of two levels. originally he had the dwarves build a spacious lower floor for entertaining guests while his chambers for study and living were upstairs. Bolios has never had any guests, however, and he jettisoned much of the furniture on the first floor when he discovered that the head was sinking, before he realized the minotaurs’ ritual was to blame.

![[7C - Head in the Clouds _D184_-1745417120612.webp]]

The first floor contains a glowing, golden glyph that is part of how The Head in the Clouds remains lighter than air. Bolios has strewn about many scrolls and books from a bookshelf on this floor in his desperate search for some way to thwart the distant minotaurs.

![[7C - Head in the Clouds _D184_-1745417143405.webp]]

The second floor is a jumble of Bolios’s studies and spartan living quarters. The red glyphs help to give The Head in the Clouds the power to move, but Bolios is not certain exactly how or why (“The fire spirits trapped within represent the animism inherent in all motion, even the planes. it’s elementary!”). A blue glyph on the floor represents the means by which the ship can be piloted. if one creature is within the circle, that creature can see outside the head as if looking out its eyes and thereby direct the vessel. it can be moved 10 squares once per turn as a move action.

# Encounter 1: Offerings to a God
**Encounter Difficulty:**   
- [ ] Severe (90 XP) Level 13

The crash of The Head in the Clouds lands it near an ettin hunting party. The enormous humanoids watched its arrival from hiding and see its landing near them as the potential blessing of a god. As soon as it stops moving, they run up and hurl their recent kills (the bodies of some hobgoblins) into the “god’s” mouth in the hopes of sating its hunger and making it happy.

When the encounter begins, the ettins are wondering what to do next. Each ettin keeps one head looking to the sky (there must be another head coming!) while the other looks to the god and talks to the other ettins about what to do (in JotUn). The ettin wrath chanter is the only one brave enough to speak to the god, but it’s also the most suspicious of the nature of the thing from the sky. The wrath chanter wants to see some godly power or it’s going to head in and claim the place for itself.

If the heroes arrive by chasing down The Head in the Clouds, they crest a nearby hill and see the ettins surrounding the head while Bolios can be heard chanting a binding ritual within it. Allow the heroes to decide how they approach the ettins, but if they take too long, the ettins enter to find the source of the noise.

If the adventurers hitched a ride on the head, they can hear the low voices of the ettins grumbling outside when they pick themselves up after the crash.

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 3: [[athach|Athach]] W

```encounter
name: Offerings to a God
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 3: [[Athach]] 
```

## Tactics
The tactics of the athach depends a lot on the behavior of the characters. If the characters attack the athach from outside The Head in the Clouds, the athach take refuge within it and hurl attacks out of the mouth. When this tactic turns foul (such as when an area power hits many of them), they run up to the level of the eyes and then to the first level of the tower where they lie in wait for the heroes (and eat Bolios if the characters are too slow).

If the adventurers attack from within The Head in the Clouds, the athach close into melee as quickly as possible.

## Features of the Area
**Attacking from The Head in the Clouds:** A creature can make attacks out of the eyes of the head, but the eyes are about 60 feet above the ground. Similarly, creatures within the tower are 100 feet, 115 feet, or 130 feet above the ground. Regardless of where the creatures are in the head or the tower, targets within 20 feet of the head have total cover. Only creatures leaning over the edge of roof of the first level of the tower can get a clear shot at targets within 20 feet of the side of the head.
**Climbing The Head in the Clouds:** A creature can climb the head with a DC 31 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check. Climbing the side of the tower requires a DC 33 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check.

# Encounter 2: Too Little Too Late
**Encounter Difficulty:**   
- [x] Severe (110 XP) Level 13

Bolios begs the characters to help him contain the elementals trapped in the glyphs. They are unraveling simultaneously and each glyph requires a creature standing on it to succeed in three successive DC 31 [[skills#Arcana|Arcana]] checks. (if Bolios is dead, a character with the Arcana skill can surmise this is the case as the glyphs flash and sputter.) Characters can aid one another, but their efforts are doomed. Bolios doesn’t know that the pool in the mouth cave serves as another point of elemental containment—a natural one that Bolios missed in his effort to turn the head into his flying fortress.

Allow the characters to make an effort to contain the elementals, but when it fails, the encounter begins. The elementals appear as indicated on the tactical map. Any creature except an elemental within a glyph area when the encounter begins is pushed out and [[conditions#Stunned|Stunned 3]].

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 2: [[Solar Crow]] W
 - 1: [[elemental-tsunami|Elemental Tsunami]] H
 - 1: [[melody-on-the-wind|Melody On The Wind]]
 - 3: [[Crystal Strider]]

```encounter
name: Too Little Too Late
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 2: [[Solar Crow]] 
- 1: [[Elemental Tsunami]]
- 1: [[Melody On The Wind]]
- 3: [[Crystal Strider]]
```

## Tactics
If Bolios lives, he tries to flee from the elementals by exiting the tower. The elementals try to prevent this, but if they can’t, any that can will pursue and attack him.

The elementals attack relentlessly, but they focus their rage on Bolios when possible. Assuming no one is on the head levels below the tower, the Elemental Tsunami moves to the first floor of the tower. The crystal striders appear touching the golden glyph encased initially in shells but break though and attack on their initiatives. The Melody of the Wind uses Mesmerizing Melody at its first opportunity while the solar crows blinding heat and then attempt anyone trying to escape.

## Features of the Area
**Bookcases:** A bookcase might be pushed over onto the 2-by-4-square area adjacent to it. if so, the pusher makes a Strength +12 attack at creatures in the area.   On a hit, the creature takes 1d8 + Strength modifier damage and falls prone. On a miss, the creature slides to the nearest open space.
**Magic Glyphs:** Any non-elemental creature that ends its turn in a square of a glyph suffers the following:
- **Blue Glyph**—`dice: 6d6` cold damage, and the creature is [[conditions#Slowed|Slowed 1]].
- **Red Glyph**—`dice: 4d8` fire damage.
- **Golden Glyph**—`dice: 3d12` damage, and a –2 penalty to all defenses (save ends).

# Encounter 3: Besieged by Demons
**Encounter Difficulty:**   
- [x] Severe (120 XP) Level 13

[[Demonic Savage Minotaur.webp|Show to Players]]
![[Demonic Savage Minotaur.webp|left|500]]

The minotaur who performed the ritual to draw down The Head in the Clouds have come to claim it. They’re not pleased to have been forced to run across the Chaos Scar, and they’ll be even less happy when they learn the head has lost the power of flight. Figuring that some other denizens of the Scar might try to claim their prize, they’ve sent ahead some demonic servants to clear the field of opposition.

The hezrou approach The Head in the Clouds cautiously, keeping in the low spots of the rolling hills and moving behind the cover of tumbled boulders and brush. They attempt to approach from a side not watched by any visible heroes. Allow any character keeping watch from the top of the tower a [[skills#Perception|Perception]] check opposed by the hezrou’s [[skills#Stealth|Stealth]] checks. otherwise, the hezrou arrive at the base of the tower undetected. One then stealthily enters the mouth while the other two climb the side of The Head in the Clouds and try to enter through the doors or hatch in the tower. Combat begins when the heroes notice the demons or when they attack catching the players off guard.

The minotaur time their arrival for 2 rounds after they detect signs that the hezrou have attacked. The minotaur magi have one of their demonic brethren with them, chained, blinded, and muzzled. Thus their first action upon their arrival is to unleash the demonic savage minotaur.

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 4: [[hezrou|Hezrou]] W
 - 1: [[savage-fiendblood-minotaur|Savage Fiendblood Minotaur]] H

```encounter
name: Besieged by Demons
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 4: [[Hezrou]] 
- 1: [[Savage Fiendblood Minotaur]]
```


## Tactics
The Hezrou want to separate the heroes, so they attempt to Grab them and then [[dimension-door|Dimension Door]] outside the tower through the arrow slits. 

The demonic savage minotaur runs up through the interior of the head and the tower to engage the first enemy it sees.

## Features of the Area
**Attacking from The Head in the Clouds:** A creature can make attacks out of the eyes of the head, but the eyes are about 60 feet above the ground. Similarly, creatures within the tower are 100 feet, 115 feet, or 130 feet above the ground. Regardless of where the creatures are in the head or the tower, targets within 20 feet of the head have total cover. Only creatures leaning over the edge of roof of the first level of the tower can get a clear shot at targets within 20 feet of the side of the head.
**Climbing The Head in the Clouds:** A creature can climb the head with a DC 31 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check. Climbing the side of the tower requires a DC 33 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check.
**Bookcases:** A bookcase might be pushed over onto the 2-by-4-square area adjacent to it. if so, the pusher makes a Strength +12 attack at creatures in the area.   On a hit, the creature takes 1d8 + Strength modifier damage and falls prone. On a miss, the creature slides to the nearest open space.
**Magic Glyphs:** Any non-elemental creature that ends its turn in a square of a glyph suffers the following:
- **Blue Glyph**—`dice: 6d6` cold damage, and the creature is [[conditions#Slowed|Slowed 1]].
- **Red Glyph**—`dice: 4d8` fire damage.
- **Golden Glyph**—`dice: 3d12` damage, and a –2 penalty to all defenses (save ends).

> [!tip]+ Treasure

# Concluding the Adventure
If Bolios survives, he’s grateful to the adventurers and begs them to help get him and his library out of the Chaos Scar. The minotaurs’ bodies might reveal some clue as to why they wanted The Head in the Clouds, 
but why that is and what adventures it might lead the characters to is up to you.

Although Bolios strengthened the bonds on the elementals in his ship, he doesn’t know how to recapture them or bond new elemental creatures. Once he has had time to do some research with his books, he’ll be happy to hire the characters to seek and capture some elementals to repower The Head in the Clouds (and probably to chase out whatever creatures inevitably move into the head after Bolios and the characters strip it of valuables and leave the Scar). As payment for these deeds, Bolios gives the characters the rest of his wealth and takes them wherever they wish to go, plus he offers to give them another free ride at a later date.

If Bolios didn’t survive, the heroes might be able to research the means of re-powering the head themselves from Bolios’s library, but they must either get the books and scrolls out of the Chaos Scar, or defend The Head in the Clouds from other curious Scar denizens. Either way, the characters must find new elementals and then reclaim the head from those who have it when they return—surely that’s a quest worthy of the reward of a flying fortress!
