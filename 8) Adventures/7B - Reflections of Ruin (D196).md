# Background
The red dragon Maluriath was once a vain creature who spent as much time lounging atop her treasure hoard as most dragons devote to gathering followers and scheming. When she chose to expand her hoard by raiding settlements, she worked in concert with her brother, Mekkalath, who was more concerned with finding a proper lair and amassing a cadre of suitably subservient underlings. 

Their concerted efforts reaped considerable rewards, but eventually Mekkalath did bring some followers to his side, and then he grew tired of dividing the spoils of their raids with his sister. He schemed to attack the ruins of Gardmore Abbey, a place rife with forgotten treasures as well as potential henchmen, and brought Maluriath along without telling her the full extent of his plans. When he subjugated the creatures there, Mekkalath revealed to his sister that the abbey was his new lair and that he now intended to conduct his affairs without her. 

Maluriath did not react immediately, realizing that it would be foolish to challenge her brother directly while his newly acquired followers surrounded him. She decided to use stealthier tactics to try to undermine his domain. She combed the abbey for the relic that the lost paladins had once hoped to contain: the Deck of Many Things. Worried that one of her brother’s cronies might discover her, she drew hastily upon the deck’s powers but failed to gain the help she wanted. As the deck overpowered Maluriath with chaotic energy, her betrayal became apparent to her brother, turning him against her and causing him to send forces to secure her hoard. She also came to the attention of a notoriously spiteful corruptor of the Nine Hells, who twisted her body into a wretched and vile form. Maluriath is unsure how she came to the devil’s attention, but chaotic forces from the Deck of Many Things now combine with the devil’s curse to wrack her with constant pain. 

Ashamed of her new form and barely sane due to the painful energy overwhelming her, Maluriath fled her brother’s domain and, in time, sought out the Chaos Scar, a place whose corruption called to her. She intended to make her lair in the forgotten depths of a dormant volcano by ousting the ogres that occupied the caves in the area. The ugly creatures suited her temperament, however, so she cowed them into servitude instead and used several of them as a repository for some of the energy that pained her greatly. 

In her attempts to break the devil’s curse of corruption, Maluriath thought the solution could be found in the creation of special arcane mirrors, but she had no success. When she placed a test subject near one of the mirrors, she hoped the mirror would give off a twisted reflection of the creature’s actual appearance. Then she would turn the reflection into truth, causing the creature to take on some of the cursed energy inside her. Instead, no matter how many mirrors she tried, her test subjects kept morphing into hideous aberrations, but without any change in her own condition. 

After failure upon failure, Maluriath changed the direction of her research. Instead of attempting to return to what she once was, she decided to visit the same twisted changes she had experienced upon the world around her to create a warped domain for herself.

# Running the Adventure
- **Job Board**[[Ailwin]] has acquired a piece of obsidian with strange properties. He wants a group to find a cave deep in the Scar and bring him back more of it for examination. He will pay 1,000 gold for this. (Reflections of Ruin)
- **A Rogue's Find** Thanks to the efforts of a treasure-hunting rogue, [[Ailwin]] of the Saruun Guildhouse is in possession of a polished fragment of obsidian that casts eerie reflections. [[Ailwin]] is curious about the obsidian’s origin (the rogue told him it came from a cave deep within the Chaos Scar) and is willing to pay 100 gp for similar objects.
- **Ill Omens** [[Chendera]] has seen ill omens and senses that world-changing corruption is building within the Chaos Scar. She hopes that a band of adventurers can succeed in investigating and destroying this evil before Lord Drysdale conscripts people and marches into the valley en masse.
- **Fool the Ogre** Assuming [[Fool]] the ogre survived "Scarred for Life,” he entreats the PCs aid in freeing his former tribe from the dragon’s enslavement. He asks the characters to fight past his kin, sparing as many as possible, to defeat Maluriath. Fool promises to lead the tribe away from human settlements, but it is up to you whether the cunning ogre makes good on his word.

> [!warning]
> **Maluriath’s Ogres**
> Each ogre the characters come up against in this adventure has a special power associated with a card from the Deck of Many Things and a unique name that is the same as the card’s. Be sure to become familiar with the roleplaying aspects of each ogre, as well as the special powers, before you run an encounter. 
> 
> In naming the ogres after the cards and branding her minions with images of the deck, Maluriath unknowingly imbued part of the artifact’s chaotic powers upon them. (Such was the case with [[Fool]], who became a wild card in his tribe and escaped.) As the adventurers battle the ogres, intimations of the powers of the Deck of Many Things become noticeable. The ogres have little understanding of why this power manifests. 
> 
> Beyond the ogres’ special powers, the chaotic spark that has touched them has also altered their original view of the world. An unexpected cunning enhances the brutal essence of many, and others have more radical changes. Adventurers might parlay in an attempt to win over some of their foes, since Maluriath has not been a kind taskmaster. If they do so, the ogres might back down from a fight, but they are unwilling to face Maluriath in her lair (Encounter 4). 
> 
> For the purpose of characters getting information from the ogres, through voluntary means or otherwise, use the description of the particular ogre as a starting point for roleplaying the interaction. In addition to giving a basic description of the cavern system’s layout, an ogre can provide one or more of the following clues about the dragon and her lair. 
> - A devil cursed Maluriath after she used forbidden magic, and the dragon has been seeking to undo the curse ever since. 
> - Maluriath made the ogres excavate the stone from around the cave’s obsidian deposits in an effort to make dark mirrors. The ogres have no idea what the dark mirrors are for. 
> - The dragon wasted perfectly good meals (wildlife, goblins, and stray travelers) by putting them in front of her mirrors and turning them into “uglies,” which is the ogres’ term for foulspawn.
> - The ogres finished their mining and polishing efforts on a very big mirror three days ago. Maluriath has been preoccupied in front of that mirror ever since then, but she murmurs about “making the valley mine.

# Encounter 1: Dumb and Ugly
**Encounter Difficulty:**   
- [ ] difficulty (xxx XP) Level xxx

![[7B - Reflections of Ruin _D196_-1743353975095.webp]]

When the adventurers reach the cave mouth (on the far eastern edge of the map), they hear Maluriath’s ritual chanting and ogres bickering over food. If the party attempts a stealthy approach, the characters must succeed on a DC 23 group [[skills#Stealth|Stealth]] check. If more than half the characters fail their checks, the dragon notices the heroes, and she bellows a warning. Otherwise, she begins shouting after characters engage the ogres in combat or conversation. 

When the heroes enter the cave, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The air within the cave is filled with smoke and the odor of burned meat. Rough stone walls enclose a spacious cavern illuminated by a cook fire tended by a ruddy-skinned ogre, who is completely enthralled by the crackling flames. Nearby, three more ogres argue over a badly scorched chunk of meat. 
> 
> Farther inside, smooth black surfaces of polished obsidian reflect warped images of the fire and ogres, as well as something from deeper within the cave. A strange, clawed limb and a portion of a large, toothy maw are apparent, but a complete image of the creature or creatures never forms. Walls and floors around these obsidian mirrors have a peculiar, scaly pattern. The stone heaves rhythmically, in time with a gurgling chant. 
> 
> Misshapen humanoids skulk in the shadows. 

When Maluriath notices the characters, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A gurgling voice emanates from the cavern’s walls. “What twist of fate brought you to despoil my triumph? The deck? The devil? It matters not. This time I shall succeed, and the creatures in this valley will learn to adore their new queen, Maluriath!” 
> 
> A pair of milky white eyes flickers within several of the mirrors. Other mirrors provide glimpses of braziers etched with arcane markings and burning with multihued flames. “Talons, Void, Flames—I have no further need of test subjects, so slay them all. Idiot—close the gate! I want no interruptions!” 
> 
> Three ogres turn their gap-toothed grins toward you as they heft their clubs. Another, holding an axe, stares slack-jawed at a rope that leads to two wooden portcullises at either end of the cavern. Strange, ghostly images flicker around their rough, filthy hides. 

Give the heroes a moment to interact with Maluriath. She harangues and taunts the adventurers before returning to her ritual. The adventurers might periodically catch a glimpse of part of the dragon’s strange shape in a mirror. Enhance the mystery of what they are facing rather than reveal what Maluriath is. 

Call attention to the brands and the strange effects surrounding the ogres. The brutes are also communicative, displaying cunning and personality, so take the opportunity to roleplay. 

> [!Special Powers]
> The ogres in this encounter are named Flames, Idiot, Talons, and Void. Each one’s personality and special power is described below. Each of these special powers requires an action to use. 
> 
> **Flames:** As his name suggests, Flames has an obsessive fascination with fire, and he is responsible for maintaining the cooking fire in this room. The flames that billow forth enthrall him, although anyone who can manipulate fire attracts his interest. Flames can add more fire to the mix by calling up a circle of flame to scorch everyone nearby.

> - **Success:** Half damage, no persistent fire
> - **Critical Success:** No damage
> ```
> 
> **Idiot:** Although many of the other ogres under Maluriath’s sway have an unusual clarity of thought, Idiot lives up to his name. He is easily manipulated and duped. If Idiot realizes that someone has played a trick on him, however, he erupts into a rage. In combat, this rage flows through him to his weapon in red waves of light, allowing him to befuddle his enemies.

> - **Miss:** Idiot becomes [[conditions#Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] and [[conditions#Slowed|Slowed 1]] instead of the target
> ```
> 
> **Talons:** Talons relishes theft, cruelty, and bullying. Due to his mean streak, many of his fellow ogres dislike him, but he doesn’t care. During combat, he sometimes snatches at a creature with his clawed hands, and gold-limned brown fog engulfs the creature momentarily.

> ```
> 
> **Void:** Occasionally disappearing for hours at a time with no recollection of where he has been, Void is the “strange one” that the other ogres shun. He is highly introspective and has an intense phobia of creatures that teleport or otherwise vanish from where they once stood. As a result, he avoids being near the foulspawn. When in combat, his eyes glow with painfully bright white light, and his intense stare can cause those he faces to scream in anguish.

> - **Failure:** The target takes `dice: 6d6+6` 6d6+6 psychic damage and is banished into a dimensional void until the end of the creature’s next turn. When the target returns, it appears in an unoccupied space within 25 feet of its original location and is [[conditions#Slowed|Slowed 1]]
> - **Success:** Half damage, and the target is not banished
> - **Critical Success:** The target is completely uneffected
> - **Miss:** Void is banished until the end of its next turn. When it returns, it appears in an unoccupied space within 25 feet of its original location and is and is [[conditions#Slowed|Slowed 1]]
