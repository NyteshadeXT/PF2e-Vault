# Background
The Proving Pit is used by the denizens of the Chaos Scar to settle disputes and to test themselves against the finest fighters in the area. A small shard of the meteorite that created the Chaos Scar lies hundreds of feet below the pit, imparting a mysterious power and personality to the location. Combatants are drawn to the area by a powerful urge to achieve victory through combat. Most combatants do not realize they are being impelled by an outside force. 

Morrn Bladeclaw was a barbarian known for his cruelty and ambition. His clan roamed the Nentir Vale region long before the formation of the Chaos Scar. Morrn advanced steadily in status among his clan. He claimed the right to become the clan’s champion and to wield the powerful Scarblade by defeating its previous owner. Driven by dreams of power, Morrn sought to prove himself worthy of the rank of chief. 

Lured onward by a vague call to battle, Morrn was drawn to the pit. There he honed his skill, always with the intent of returning to his home as the greatest champion of all. Morrn soon dominated all contenders at the pit, but in turn, he was dominated by the shard’s presence. The longer he stayed, the less he cared about leaving and the more he became part of the place. His thoughts of clan leadership drained away. Morrn’s goal of becoming the greatest champion of all was realized, but not as he had planned. He was a slave of the Proving Pit, with no thoughts of returning to his tribe. 

The pit, however, has no use for eternal champions. Morrn was mortally wounded by a wizard of great power who coveted the Scarblade. The wizard was cut down by Morrn’s dying blow, and both perished on the bloodstained floor of the Proving Pit. Under the influence of the pit, bystanders buried Morrn below the arena’s central dais. The Scarblade was encased in translucent crystal and embedded along the pit’s north wall, where it can be seen by all who fight and die in the pit. 

Morrn’s ghost haunts the area. Though he cannot use his sword, he longs for the feel of it in his grasp and still thrills to the roar of the crowd when an opponent crumples to the dirt.

## Psychic Connections
Both the Proving Pit and the Scarblade call out to characters in the hope of luring them to the arena. Despite their seeming similarities, they are not a team. The sword and the pit have different methods and different goals. In fact, the conflict between the two is a principal element in the adventure, so it is important to understand what they want and how they go about pursuing their aims.

You are the best judge of how these psychic communications should be handled. In groups with a strong storytelling focus, all of this can be completely open, so that everyone can enjoy the unfolding character conflicts while trusting that players will not act on information that their characters don’t have. In groups that enjoy mysteries, intrigue, and some internal conflict, you could handle the psychic overtures of the pit and the sword by passing secret notes to chosen players; everyone at the table will know that something is up, but only a few will have an inkling of what it is. In groups that focus on combat, it might be best to let everyone know that something or someone is trying to influence their thoughts. When they’re good and mad about that, then turn them loose against the pit and Morrn Bladeclaw.

**The Proving Pit** The pit seeks to draw intelligent creatures to itself and to trap them in a cycle of violence, combat, and killing. Psychic calls from the Proving Pit manifest themselves as strong emotions and instinctive urges. They build upon a character’s natural desire for victory, glory, and combat.

Because it is animated by the buried chaos shard, the pit has a degree of influence over the surrounding terrain. Once characters move into the range of the pit’s influence, they find that the way forward is much easier than the way back. Their dreams, daydreams, and stray thoughts are pervaded with visions of themselves as great victors in a competitive arena. These visions are innocuous, at least at first; the arena is glorious, the competitions fair and nonlethal. When the pit finds a receptive mind, however, these images change quickly to become more violent and bloody.

The range of the pit’s psychic effect is up to you; a radius of a half-mile to two miles is recommended. There’s no reason why a particularly susceptible character could not feel the pit’s lure from Restwell Keep, if that serves your storytelling style.

**The Scarblade** The sword has no connection to the chaos shard. It is an ages old magic weapon. Its range for making contact with characters is about five miles. The sword specifically targets characters who can wield it with some mastery, and it ignores all others. It speaks to a character while that person is resting or calm, and it appeals directly to his or her martial spirit.

The blade wants to be released from its crystal prison and once again used in mortal combat by a brave warrior. It’s not an overtly evil weapon, but it shares the barbarians’ love for battle and sees nothing wrong with killing in pursuit of glory. It no longer has any particular attachment to Morrn Bladeclaw.

The Scarblade will help a character who is fighting in the Proving Pit, if it considers that character to be a promising candidate to become the sword’s new owner. When one of the character’s attacks misses by just 1 or 2, whisper to the player, “I can help.” Let the player know this is the same entity that contacted him or her earlier. If the character assents to being helped, then give the character a +2 bonus on the attack roll that just missed, turning that miss into a hit. Then have the character make a saving throw. If it succeeds, the Scarblade will repeat the offer the next time the character’s attack misses by 1 or 2. If the saving throw fails, the Scarblade won’t repeat the offer to that character.

**Telling Them Apart** At first, psychic contact by the sword and the pit will be easily confused, because both want to lure heroes to the Proving Pit. The clues that can help characters realize they’re dealing with two different entities are:
- The Proving Pit appeals to emotions such as anger, hate, and arrogance, while the Scarblade appeals to pride and ambition.
- The pit creates a vision of armed competition that starts out clean but soon becomes vicious and bloody in a way that thrills the viewer. The Scarblade creates a vision of personal triumph occurring largely on the field of battle rather than in a competitive arena.
- The pit’s visions show the viewer as a more powerful, idealized, yet subtly debased version of the character. The Scarblade’s visions also show the character as powerful and idealized, but always as armed with an unfamiliar sword

# Running the Adventure
Select one or more of the following adventure hooks and adapt it to your campaign.
- The adventurers hear tales of the Scarblade from a bard at the Slumbering Giant one night. Provide them with a general description of the sword and the Proving Pit. The source might also relate some of Morrn Bladeclaw’s history.
- The Scarblade wants to escape from the pit, and it sometimes calls out psychically to an adventurer it believes is capable of freeing it and wielding it, even if only temporarily.
- The Proving Pit psychically calls to one or more of the most powerful characters, making promises of power and glory for those who are victorious. Characters might experience visions of themselves defeating their companions, or of using the mighty Scarblade to defeat their longtime foes.
- The adventurers enter the valley of the Proving Pit, either intentionally or because it happens to be in their path, and find it difficult to escape. Once there, they encounter the Scarblade.

Should the players start inquiring with locals about either the Scarblade or the Proving Pit share some of the following rumors with them. Note that not all of this information is accurate.
- Morrn Bladeclaw was a barbarian warrior known for his cruelty and ambition. He steadily rose in status in his clan until he claimed the right to become its champion by defeating the wielder of a powerful artifact known as Scarblade. One of Morrn’s tribal enemies eventually killed him but was unable to wrest Scarblade from the dead man’s hands. Now the corpse of Morrn Bladeclaw fights anyone who will face him, with Scarblade as the prize for the victor.
- The Proving Pit is used by the denizens of the Chaos Scar to settle disputes between themselves or to test themselves against other fighters of many kinds. A splinter of the meteorite that created the Chaos Scar lies hundreds of feet below the surface of the pit, giving the place itself a malevolent cunning. 
- No one who enters the pit has ever managed to leave it; either they die facing Morrn Bladeclaw, or they kill him, take Scarblade, and instantly assume Morrn’s curse. In fact, dozens of warriors have held the blade over the years, but none have carried it out of the Proving Pit.
- Morrn Bladeclaw came to the Proving Pit intending to win Scarblade, and he did. Now, the blade makes him invincible and immortal. He could leave anytime he wanted to, but he enjoys the killing too much.
- After capturing Scarblade from a frost giant, Morrn was assassinated by a wizard of great power who sought the mighty weapon. With his final breath, Morrn Bladeclaw cursed the wizard to forever fight anyone who came to claim the blade.
- The Scarblade is encased in a translucent crystal spire above a gladiatorial pit. Anyone who defeats the pit’s champion can claim it.

# Through the Rugged Forest
The Proving Pit lies in a secluded valley that is surrounded by low, steep hills. Only a few lightly used trails wind through the rugged woods, hills, and ravines. The adventurers might learn of these trails from a map or from residents of the region, they might cross one of them by chance, or they might be led to one by the pit or the sword.

Through its connection to the chaos shard, the pit manipulates nearby terrain to make it as difficult as possible for anyone to leave the valley. The surrounding hillsides are sprinkled with the remains of those who tried and failed. Nothing of value remains on any of the corpses, but at your discretion, characters might find a letter or diary or some other indication of what lies ahead.

The pit’s efforts to herd the characters to the valley floor are subtle. As long as characters are moving generally downhill and toward the pit, they don’t meet any significant obstacles to their progress. Should they turn back the way they came or begin moving uphill, the pit begins unleashing hazards in their path. It is possible that the characters will descend directly to the bottom and not trigger any hazards at this time. If they try to leave without defeating the pit, the hazards will be waiting for them.

Four sample hazards are included below. These can be encountered as you see fit, and you can add other terrain obstacles of your own. The encounter map shows one possible arrangement of hazards and corpses along a particularly dangerous section of trail. Rearrange them as needed to fit the situation.

Bear in mind that the purpose of the hazards is not to kill or injure the characters. Careful and clever players can find ways to avoid or overcome any static obstacle. The real purpose of the terrain hazards is to arouse the characters’ suspicion and curiosity about this place. When they get the idea that the land itself is trying to prevent them from leaving, they’re bound to wonder why.

The crumbling trail and the collapsing trail appear not much different from any other places where the path is steep and gravelly.

# The Proving Pit
On reaching the valley floor, the characters emerge from the trees and get their first look at the Proving Pit and the Scarblade. The area is abandoned at first. Allow the characters a few minutes to poke around and get their bearings but not enough time to really explore the area. The buildings are mostly abandoned, but there are signs of recent inhabitants. 

After a few minutes, Morrn Bladeclaw appears. He is followed by the pit’s denizens, both real and spectral; then challenges are issued to the characters. 

When characters reach the valley floor, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The dense forest along the trail opens onto the floor of a small glen. A few well-worn dirt paths flanked by scrub bushes lead to a wide, irregularly shaped pit with an eroded and crumbling edge. The valley floor slopes gently toward the pit. Around it stand a few crumbling, decrepit shacks and decaying wooden bleachers that provide an unobstructed view into the depression. The sky is overcast, and light rain is beginning to fall. Through the gloom, a pale glow shimmers wanly from the pit.

When characters look into the pit, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Before you is a well-used gladiatorial arena, battle-scarred and bloodstained. It is 10 feet deep, and the walls of eroded stone and crumbling soil are nearly vertical. They are interspersed with dark, barred windows and narrow, rusted doors. A dais dominates the center of the pit. Rain is gathering into shallow puddles on the floor.
> 
> The scene is bathed in a pale blue light that emanates from a block of crystal on the south wall. Within the translucent crystal is a dark shape that suggests the contours of a large sword.
> 
> A humanoid apparition shimmers into view atop the low dais. It carries a spectral sword that resembles the object in the crystal. It studies you for a few moments, then raises its hands and speaks, turning slowly in place as if addressing an unseen audience. “Who yearns for justice? Judgment? Fame? Who seeks glory through victory over all challengers?” Then it faces you and points the sword toward you. “They do. They have come to confront their destiny in the Proving Pit!”

The characters can converse with the spectral figure of Morrn Bladeclaw. His speech is harsh and aggressive. He will describe the pit, its purpose, and even his own history, but not at great length. He expects the characters to compete.

If someone asks about the sword, he replies that it is the ultimate prize for victory, and one worthy of the greatest champion in the land—which is he.

All of Morrn Bladeclaw’s conversation steers toward getting the characters to prove their worth by fighting. 

If someone agrees, a ghostly horn appears in Morrn’s fist. He raises it to his lips and blows out a long, mournful note. As the note fades, other shapes come into view in the surrounding stands. Phantom humanoids of every kind—pit shadows, spirits of combatants long dead—have gathered to enjoy the spectacle. A few living combatants appear at the pit doors.

If the characters do not agree but they are already in the pit, Morrn blows the horn anyway. If the characters are not in the pit but are near the edge, the ground buckles as if alive and the edge crumbles to dump them into the pit; use the crumbling trail or collapsing trail hazard. Characters can retreat from the area if they so choose, but the pit will harry them with hazards during the entire trek out of the valley, and it will fill their minds with visions of shame and defeat until they get beyond its range.

Morrn is the master and grand champion of the pit, and he does not fight in any preliminary matches. Before characters can challenge Morrn, each of them must win at least one preliminary match. Morrn doesn’t mention this up front (he doesn’t expect the characters to survive that long). He will explain it if asked.

Matches can be fought one-on-one or in teams. In team matches, the opponents should include at least three pit shadows. Early matches will be against foes of the characters’ level, but as the characters accumulate victories (assuming there is more than one match), the opposition gets tougher. 

The first opponent Morrn pits against the newcomers is Marok, a half-orc death mage and the pit’s current champion. You can substitute any appropriate foe, dead or alive. If more than one character wants to fight Marok, he can be accompanied by several pit shadows plus a suitable number of orc rampagers, orc pummelers, and orc storm shamans. 

One round after combat begins, Morrn activates the spiked chain pinwheel trap. 

There are no rules, and all fights are to the death unless a character runs away. Someone who retreats from a fight will be jeered cruelly by the spectators, be pelted with rotten fruit or stones, and possibly pursued by enemies if other characters don’t intervene. 

Portions of the pit’s rim that are noted as danger- ous should be treated as crumbling trail hazards.

Characters can fight as many matches in the pit as they like. The spectators are against the newcom- ers at first, but if they fight multiple matches and put on a good show, the crowd swings noticeably in their favor. Characters can take a short rest after the first match. After that, Morrn tries to start a new match immediately after the last one ends, so that a charac- ter who fights back-to-back matches has no chance to rest between them. If the party is 7th level, you can relax this a bit. If the party is 9th level, press them hard. 

## Development
Once each character has fought and won at least once, either individually or as part of a group, the characters can challenge Morrn Bladeclaw. If the players don’t think of this on their own, or don’t seem inclined to do it, the crowd begins to chant, “Bladeclaw! Bladeclaw!”

# Morrn Bladeclaw and the Scarblade

When Morrn is ready to fight the characters, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> “Few dare face me, and fewer survive. I know the draw of the Scarblade. I know the drive of the pit. Long have I heard their whispers. Perhaps you will join the shadowy spectators, if the pit deems you worthy. I salute your courage now, before the match. Afterward, a salute would be too late for you.”

Morrn Bladeclaw is willing to fight alone against one or two characters, just as he did as a gladiator. He won’t fight the whole party by himself, however. If everyone gangs up against him, he calls on the aid of past victims. They appear in the form of pit shadows, a blue arcanian, and dread guardians. The blue arcanian represents the wizard who slew Morrn, and was slain by him, in the bout that cost Morrn his life. The pit shadows and dread guardians are nameless foes he vanquished over his career. Use enough foes to make this a level +2 encounter for the characters.

No other competitors or spectators join in. Many of them would love to see Morrn defeated, but they fear attacking him themselves.

At the start of this final bout, several massive stone blocks (shown on the map) slowly rise from the pit floor to stand 10 feet high.

## Development
When Morrn first becomes bloodied, the real Scarblade senses that his destruction is near. It triggers a crevasse as an immediate reaction, which shatters the crystal and splits the ground from the block of crystal to the center of the pit. The sword psychically calls out to the character it deems best suited to wield it, though anyone can pick it up from the shattered bits of crystal, including Morrn Bladeclaw. If a character grabs it, Morrn focuses all his attacks against that character. 

If Morrn is killed, the pit becomes dormant for 24 hours. The spiked chain pinwheel grinds to a halt. The pit shadows disappear, and any living combatants slink away into the forest or into the rooms adjoining the pit. Some of them might speak to the characters or even congratulate them. A few might even immediately challenge them for the weapon. For the next 24 hours, everyone is free to leave the valley unhindered. If the Scarblade is removed from the valley within that time, Morrn’s ghost is released from the valley and never returns. A day later, the Proving Pit reactivates and slowly begins calling new combatants.

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** During the day, bright illumination from an overcast sky. At night, dim illumination cast by the crystal block that holds the Scarblade. Dim illumination in the buildings and pit rooms. 
**Blocks (red shaded areas):** These are solid stone blocks 10 feet high. They rise up from the floor only for the final battle against Morrn Bladeclaw.
**Puddles:** Puddles are difficult terrain.
**Rubble:** Rubble and large rocks are difficult terrain and provide partial cover.
**Low Dais:** The low stone dais includes Morrn Bladeclaw’s horizontal headstone, which indicates that he died 30 years ago. The dais is normal terrain.
**Pit:** The pit is 3 squares (15 feet) deep.
**Walls:** The walls are easy to grip but unstable. A DC 30 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check is required to climb.
**Pit Rooms:** These small rooms are used to hold combatants, willingly or unwillingly. Some have decaying ladders that lead to trapdoors (T) on the surface. From above, the trapdoors are overgrown with 
moss and weeds, so that a DC 36 [[skills#Perception|Perception]] check is needed to spot one.
**Crystal Block:** This glowing crystal provides cover and holds the Scarblade. It is immune to all damage but shatters when Morrn Bladeclaw is first bloodied.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
