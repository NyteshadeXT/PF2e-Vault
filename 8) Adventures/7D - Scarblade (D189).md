# Background
The Proving Pit is used by the denizens of the Chaos Scar to settle disputes and to test themselves against the finest fighters in the area. A small shard of the meteorite that created the Chaos Scar lies hundreds of feet below the pit, imparting a mysterious power and personality to the location. Combatants are drawn to the area by a powerful urge to achieve victory through combat. Most combatants do not realize they are being impelled by an outside force. 

Morrn Bladeclaw was a barbarian known for his cruelty and ambition. His clan roamed the Nentir Vale region long before the formation of the Chaos Scar. Morrn advanced steadily in status among his clan. He claimed the right to become the clan’s champion and to wield the powerful Scarblade by defeating its previous owner. Driven by dreams of power, Morrn sought to prove himself worthy of the rank of chief. 

Lured onward by a vague call to battle, Morrn was drawn to the pit. There he honed his skill, always with the intent of returning to his home as the greatest champion of all. Morrn soon dominated all contenders at the pit, but in turn, he was dominated by the shard’s presence. The longer he stayed, the less he cared about leaving and the more he became part of the place. His thoughts of clan leadership drained away. Morrn’s goal of becoming the greatest champion of all was realized, but not as he had planned. He was a slave of the Proving Pit, with no thoughts of returning to his tribe. 

The pit, however, has no use for eternal champions. Morrn was mortally wounded by a wizard of great power who coveted the Scarblade. The wizard was cut down by Morrn’s dying blow, and both perished on the bloodstained floor of the Proving Pit. Under the influence of the pit, bystanders buried Morrn below the arena’s central dais. The Scarblade was encased in translucent crystal and embedded along the pit’s north wall, where it can be seen by all who fight and die in the pit. 

Morrn’s ghost haunts the area. Though he cannot use his sword, he longs for the feel of it in his grasp and still thrills to the roar of the crowd when an opponent crumples to the dirt.
