# Background
No matter how inhospitable, barren, or simply vile a place is, some creature calls it home. There are monsters who dwell in the depths of the world, so far underground that the sun is a wild legend and even light is a rarity beyond compare. There are things who dwell in bubbling lava, in the icy wastes of the uttermost north, or in the harshest of deserts. The Goblin Hole is not quite so dangerous as those places, but it is a place only goblins could love—a steep-sided pit filled with ordure, strange fungal growths, thousands of nasty spiders, and squirming things with odd numbers of legs. In the past, adventurers have descended into the Hole and cleared out the denizens, but the goblins always return. 

The current chieftain of the local goblins and self-styled ‘King of the Hole’ is Urgog the Mangler, who in his youth was a feared goblin warrior. In those years, he and his marauders raided human villages and put elf-woods to the torch. It is said that Urgog personally slew hundreds and that his tent was made out of the flayed skin of adventurers and knights who tried to stop his rampage. Eventually, the short lifespan of goblin-kind caught up with Urgog. His strength and cunning faded and his warband suffered a series of defeats. They were driven deep into the Chaos Scar, where most of the goblins perished and there was no further sign of Urgog the Mangler for years. It was assumed that he had been destroyed by some greater monster. 

In fact, the goblin survived. In the scar, Urgog found an ugly lump of magical crystal, a shard of the meteor that made the scar long ago. Fearing that some thief might steal his prize, he took the shard to a place where it would be safe and secure—the bottom of the Goblin Hole! 

Once Urgog took up residence in the hole, other goblins were drawn there. Today, he rules over a tribe of some fifty goblins. The eldritch influence of the chaos shard in Urgog’s possession has given the goblins a strange affinity with the spiders who also infest the hole. Since Urgog arrived, the spiders have grown larger and more intelligent. 

The most powerful of these spiders has transformed into an unusually intelligent horror, a feyspitter spider that is now the power behind Urgog’s throne. At night, the spider whispers into Urgog’s ear, advising him on how to manipulate his followers and expand his influence. For his part, Urgog is quite happy to have a giant, intelligent spider in the Goblin Hole. It’s an impressive pet and a useful ally. He dreams of a horde of spider-riding goblins swarming over the world, conquering everything that stands in their path. 

Once again, goblin raiders shouting Urgog’s name are attacking human settlements. Once again, brave adventurers must go down the Goblin Hole

# Running the Adventure
**Total Adventure Value:** 395 xp

## Adventure Hooks
There are several ways to get the characters involved in this adventure. 

**Get a Job**
Kendon Longstrider, posts a request and reward of 50 gp on the local job board to have a band of adventurers clear out the Goblin Hole.  See the Restwell Jobs section.

**Raiders**
Goblin raiders were sighted east of the King’s Wall. Traditionally, the goblins have used the Goblin Hole as a base in that area. Someone should investigate the hole and find out how the goblins were able to cross the wall so easily. (They scaled the wall on the backs of their spider minions.) Worryingly, some of the goblins were shouting the name Urgog as a battle-cry. 

**Divinations**
Magical divinations by Chendera, the half-elf cleric who oversees the temple of Tymora at Restwell Keep, point to the existence of some growing threat in the depths of the woods. Unless stopped, this threat may grow too powerful to be dealt with easily, so heroes must put an end to it quickly. She advises the characters to seek out the rumored “Goblin Hole” and begin investigating there. 

**Hapless Adventurer**
Another adventurer encountered a band of goblins crossing through the lands east of the Scar. These goblins were pushing a crudely-made cart laden with swords, helmets, and other booty. The adventurer captured one of the goblins and questioned the wretch, who revealed that the cart was “tribute for Urgog the Mangler, King of the Goblin Hole.

## Getting Started 
### Research
A [[skills#Society|Society]] roll (DC15) or consulting with local greybeards (such as the silver-masked mage [[Ailwin|Ailwin]] at Restwell Keep) lets the characters find out that Urgog was once a feared goblin warlord, but no one has heard of him in more than ten years. 

### Down the Goblin Hole 
After crossing the King’s Wall, the characters travel into the woodlands in the south of the Chaos Scar. The forests here are thick and dark, with few clear trails. In places, the trees are strangely twisted and mutated by the malign influence of the Scar. Initially, the adventurers do not encounter any threatening beasts, but they cannot escape the feeling that they are being watched by inhuman eyes in the dark of the woods. 

### Goblin Ambush 
> [!tip]+ Skill Challenge - Ambushing the Ambushers
> As they approach the Goblin Hole, characters see signs of the goblins—footprints, discarded arrowheads, small paths cut through the underbrush, and the stumps of smaller trees cut down for firewood. If the characters blunder on through the woods, then they automatically run into the goblin ambush (Encounter 1). If they proceed carefully, run the optional skill challenge, Ambushing the Ambushers.

**Tactical Encounter 1:** The Goblin Ambush 

# Encounter 1 - Goblin Ambushers
![[Pasted image 20230704164200.png]]

**Encounter Difficulty:** Moderate (100 xp)
Creatures:
 - 4: [[goblin-warrior|Goblin Sniper]] G
 - 2: [[vine-lasher|Vine Lasher]] V
 - 1: [[deathjump-spider|Deathjump Spider]] D
 - 2: [[spider-swarm|Spider Swarm]]

```encounter
name: Hangman
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 4: [[Goblin Warrior]] 
- 2: [[Vine Lasher]]
- 1: [[Deathjump Spider]]
- 2: [[Spider Swarm]]
```

The goblin snipers are in the trees, 15 feet above the ground. The deathjump spider also starts in the trees but jumps down to join the fight as soon as battle begins. 

**If the characters failed or did not attempt the “Ambushing the Ambushers” skill check, then read the following aloud before setting up the encounter.** 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> As you make your way through the forest, you spot something glistening between two trees. It’s a strand of spider web, so thin as to be almost invisible if it were not for some droplets of dew. Looking more closely, you realize that there’s a full web stretching between those two trees ... and the trees next to them. You’re hemmed in on all sides by webbing. It’s a trap! 

The characters start in the web-covered area at the bottom of the map. If a character tries to move out of this area, then he must make a DC20 Athletics check or be restrained (save ends). 

**If the characters succeeded in the skill check, read the following section aloud instead.** 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Just in time, you spot a cunningly hidden spider web stretching between two trees. You cautiously make your way around the web and find several other, similar webs between other trees. You came close to falling into someone’s trap... 

In this case, the characters start in the open beyond the web-covered area. 

## Tactics
The goblin snipers stay in the trees and keep firing, targeting characters caught in the spider web if possible. If the characters get too close, they move through the trees to keep out of melee range. 

The vine lashers stay in the middle of the battlefield and use their impaling thorns and pulling vines to drag grabbed characters back toward the bottom of the map, away from the snipers. The vines attack melee characters first. 

The deathjump spider uses its death from above attack to move quickly around the battlefield. Ideally, it knocks down the character nearest to the goblins to give the vine lashers a chance to grab and drag that character. If none of the heroes are close to the goblins, then the deathjump spider tries to set up flanking attacks with the spiderlings and vines. When surrounded, it uses prodigious leap to flee back to the safety of the trees. 

## Development 
A clear trail leads off from the ambush site toward the Goblin Hole. 

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> Searching the webbed copse of trees turns up the corpse of another adventurer who wandered into the trap and starved to death. His body has been sucked dry by the spiders, but his equipment is still intact. Characters can salvage a longsword, leather armor, and 45 gold pieces from the corpse.

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** It’s daylight. 

**Trees:** The goblin snipers have concealment thanks to the foliage of the trees, giving a -2 penalty to attack rolls targeting them. They are 15 feet off the ground, so they can only be hit by ranged attacks or weapons with Reach. Climbing a tree requires a DC 15 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] skill check. The trees are so close together that their branches have interwoven, allowing characters to move between adjacent trees without needing to climb back down. The trees are considered difficult terrain. 

**Webs:** One copse of trees is covered in sticky webs that trap creatures who blunder in, making that copse into a potential killing ground if characters did not succeed at the “Ambushing the Ambushers” skill challenge; see above.

# Encounter 2 - The Webwall
![[Pasted image 20230705160337.png]]

**Encounter Difficulty:** Severe (155 xp)

Once the goblin ambush in the ravine is dealt with, the characters can descend into the Goblin Hole proper—the caves under the ravine. The cave walls are covered in fungal growths and more spider webs. In places, the characters must clamber down steep and treacherous slopes, as the caves are arranged one atop the next. Each step brings the characters deeper underground. A quick retreat is impossible. 

There are signs of goblins everywhere—chewed bones, dirty blankets, discarded trash, and insulting messages or strange ritual symbols daubed onto the walls. The goblins living in the caves dare not confront powerful invaders directly. They will wait for Urgog the Mangler to slay the trespassers. 

The cave tiles represent the flat bottom of the ravine. Three sides of the ravine are so steep they cannot be climbed. The fourth side is represented by the webbed tile. This tile represents a wall that is perpendicular to the other tiles—the encounter begins with the player characters climbing down this near vertical cliff. 

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 2: [[goblin-warrior|Goblin Warrior]] W
 - 2: [[goblin-war-chanter|Goblin War Chanter]] H

```encounter
name: Hangman
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 2: [[Goblin Warrior]] 
- 2: [[Goblin War Chanter]]
```

There is also a [[hidden-pit|hidden pit]] at the bottom of the cliff (marked by Xs). 

When any character comes within four squares of the bottom of the cliff, the following foes emerge from shadowy holes in the cliff wall. A character who ends his turn within four squares of the cliff bottom can spot the hidden enemies with a DC15 [[skills#Perception|Perception]] check. 
 - 2: [[deathjump-spider|Deathjump Spider]] D
 - 2: [[spider-swarm|Spider Swarm]] S

```encounter
name: Hangman
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 2: [[Deathjump Spider]]
- 2: [[Spider Swarm]]
```

When any character reaches the bottom of the cliff, the following foes emerge: 
 - 4: [[goblin-warrior|Goblin Cutter]]

```encounter
name: Hangman
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 4: [[Goblin Warrior, Goblin Cutter]] 
```

## Tactics
Keep one warrior or cutter adjacent to the war chanter at all times so he can use lead from the rear to deflect attacks. 

The warriors and cutters stay at the bottom of the cliff, moving enough to take advantage of their great position ability as they hurl javelins up at the characters. If they run out of javelins, they form a defensive line and await the characters. If possible, they stay within the hex hurler’s vexing cloud. The cutters join the fight as soon as a character reaches the bottom— and that includes falling into the pit. They try to swarm the characters and set up flanking attacks for any surviving warriors or spiders. 

The spiders can move freely on the webs thanks to their climb speed, so they can position themselves to best attack the characters. They do not use death from above attacks while on the cliff wall but may use those attacks on characters who have reached the bottom of the ravine. 

While characters cling to the wall, they fight at a severe disadvantage against the spiders. If they jump down to escape the spiders, the goblin cutters rush out, making this an out-of-the-frying-pan-and-into-the-fire encounter. As with the [[02) Goblin Ambushers|Goblin Ambushers]]  encounter, the characters could wind up badly outnumbered, but most of their foes are minions. 

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> On bodies of some unfortunate victions the players can find a pouch containing 10 gold coins and a *[[healing-potion|healing potion]] (lesser)*. A character who searches the cavern wall can also find a space hidden behind a rock with a DC 15 [[skills#Perception|Perception]] check. Hidden in this space are a [[shifting|Shifting Rune]] and [[wounding-oil-tv|Wounding Oil]].

## Features of the Area 
**Illumination:** While the steep-sided ravine is in shadow, it’s still considered brightly illuminated. 

**Hole:** The hole leads to the cavern under the ravine. 

**Web-Covered Cliff:** Moving along the cliff requires an [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check (DC10) to move at half speed. Characters who are pulled or pushed off the cliff or who are knocked prone will fall unless they make a [[grab-an-edge|grab and edge]] action. The cliff is 35 feet tall; a character who falls takes 1d10 damage per 10 feet fallen (but see Pit Trap). 

**Pit Trap:** The pit at the base of the cliff is a false floor pit trap. Characters who land in the pit take reduced falling damage—1d6 per 10 feet fallen instead of 1d10—because the deep slime at the pit’s bottom cushions the landing somewhat (but also makes the walls more difficult to climb). This pit can’t be disarmed or disabled.

# Encounter 3 - Spiders & Goblins & Kings
![[Pasted image 20230705164423.png]]

**Encounter Difficulty:** Severe (140 xp)

## The Bottom of the Hole 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> After slipping and sliding through three smaller chambers, you arrive at a larger cave. In the center of the floor is a large hole which leads into a still deeper cavern. Crude rope ladders are tied to stalagmites that dangle into the hole, and you can see torchlight from below. A voice roars from beneath you. ‘I am Urgog the Mangler, Urgog the war-chief, the King of the Goblin Hole! Come down and fight! Come down and die!’ After a momentary pause, the voice says ‘are you sure they’re up there? I can’t hear anything!’ 

A [[skills#Perception|perception]] check (DC15) lets the characters hear a strange, chittering noise: the speech of the shard spider assuring Urgog that the adventurers are indeed close at hand. It’s impossible to use missile attacks to strike at Urgog or his guards from the upper cavern, so the characters must climb down the ladders to slay the goblin chieftain. 

Place the following foes on the map at the start of the encounter: 
 - 2: [[goblin-warrior|Goblin Cutthroat]] G
 - 1: [[shard-spider|Shard Spider]] F
 - 1: [[goblin-underboss|Urgog]] U 

```encounter
name: Spiders & Goblins & Kings 2
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 2: [[Goblin Warrior, Goblin Cutthroat]] 
- 1: [[Shard Spider]]
- 1: [[Goblin Underboss, Urgog]]
```

On round four, add the following foes:
 - 4: [[goblin-warrior|Goblin Cutter]]
 - 1: [[goblin-warrior|Goblin Warrior]]

```encounter
name: Spiders & Goblins & Kings 2
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 4: [[Goblin Warrior, Goblin Cutter]] 
- 1: [[Goblin Warrior]]
```

The player characters start in the middle of the cavern. 

## Tactics
Urgog keeps his two cutthroat henchmen close by at all times. The three gang up on the most dangerous foes, using goblin tactics to stay in flanking positions so the cutthroats have combat advantage. 

The shard spider keeps moving and attacking.

On round 2, 4 goblin cutters and 1 goblin warrior arrive in the upper chamber. They act as follows: 

**Round 2:** Push rocks down from above. These goblins working together make a single rockslide attack as described below. The attack occurs on the slowest of the goblins’ initiative points. It is centered on the square marked X on the map. 

**Round 3:** The goblins make another rockslide attack. 

**Round 4:** The goblins swing down on ropes from the upper chamber and attack. The momentum of swinging down on a rope counts as a charge. They move to link up with Urgog if he is still alive. Otherwise, they just attack the nearest enemies. 

## Development 
The shard of the meteor discovered by Urgog is lodged in the webs of the spider. The characters can cut it free from the webs and take it with them. Its specific properties and hazards are up to you, depending on what plans you have for further developments and what measures the characters take to protect themselves. 

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> In addition the the [[striking|+1 Striking Shortsword]] used by Urgog.  His treasure hoard is in a chest under his throne. It consists of [[sarkorian-god-caller-garb-lotgb|Sarkorian God-caller Garb]], [[heartening-missive-rabbit-tv|Heartening Missive (Rabbit)]], [[eidetic-potion-tv|Eidetic Potion]] and 34 gold pieces. 

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** The webs of the phase spider glow dimly on the walls, providing dim illumination. 

**Ceilings:** The ceiling of this chamber is 15 feet high. Ropes and Ladders: These aren’t shown on the map. They hang from the upper chamber to the lower one, allowing a character to drop into any of the 16 outlined squares.
