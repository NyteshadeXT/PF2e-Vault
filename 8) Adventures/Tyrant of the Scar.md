The Eye Tyrant the players released from it's prison has been experimenting with the chaotic energy it has found throughout the Scar.  Little by little it has been transformed into a new and deadly creature.  Unknown to the creature another entity has taken particular interest, Kataklysmos.  He has decided to use the Tyrant to attack and hopefully defeat the PCs as they are starting to get to close to his followers.

This encounter can take place anywhere in the scar.  The players will find themselves between to small hills.  Over the hill in front of them emerges the Chaos-Scarred Eye Tyrant.  Suddenly the world freezes and a manifestation of Kataklysmos appears to taunt the PCs and wish them an end.

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> As you crest the ragged, grass-swept hill, the air turns heavy—electric with chaotic energy. Jagged crystal formations jut from the scarred ground, humming with unnatural resonance. Then, over the ridge ahead, a monstrous shape drifts into view.
> 
> A massive, orb-like creature, its flesh split and warped by glowing shards of emerald chaos, rises slowly into the air. Its central eye burns with fury. From its body, mutated eyestalks twitch and writhe, each one sparking with unstable magic. The very ground seems to tremble at its arrival.
> 
> And then—Everything freezes.
> 
> Time halts mid-motion: the wind no longer swirls through the grass, sound vanishes, and your own breaths feel distant, trapped in stillness. A tear rips open in the sky above, not with light, but with void—deep, hungry, and shifting with colors that shouldn't exist. From it, a shape coils downward: a roiling silhouette of madness, constantly shifting between forms, impossible to define. Two burning crimson eyes stare down upon you from the form of **Kataklysmos**—God of Chaos and Destruction. 
> 
> His voice is a thousand whispers and a thunderclap all at once: _**"I had not expected you to come so far… nor live so long. But now, you stand where only the foolish or the fated tread."   "This one—"**_ his gaze tilts to the mutated Eye Tyrant, _**"—is but my finger upon this world. Through it, I test your resolve. Through its ruin, I herald your end."**_
> 
> A pause—just long enough to unnerve—_**"But take comfort, little sparks. The Scar remembers all… and when one of you joins me in time, they shall carry your memories into the final reckoning. Perhaps... even your name."**_
> 
> The vision snaps away. The wind howls. Time rushes forward again—and the **Chaos-Scarred Eye Tyrant** shrieks as it rises higher, its eye burning, its stalks charging.

## Tactics
The Tyrant Opens with Mutated Gaze, suppresses antimagic if needed, favors crowd control and teleport-based disruption. Uses Chaotic Mutation to adapt to threats.

When the Tyrant dies read the following:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> As the final blow strikes true, the Eye Tyrant convulses in midair. Its enormous central eye cracks, leaking violet ichor and shimmering arcane residue. The floating monstrosity spasms, its eyestalks twitching violently, then falling limp as it begins to descend. But before it hits the ground, a whisper echoes directly into your minds—a voice not its own, yet _buried_ within it:
> 
> _**"He... watches through me..."**_
> 
> The Tyrant’s body trembles, warping unnaturally as if pulled in every direction.
> 
> _**"You think this is victory? A fragment shatters..." "...but the storm... gathers..."**_
> 
> Its voice splinters now, sounding like multiple minds struggling to speak at once: _**"You will join us... one of you... has already begun to dream."**_
> 
> A final pulse of chaotic energy erupts from the body—briefly illuminating the faces of each adventurer with shifting light—and then all goes still. The Tyrant collapses to the earth, a grotesque ruin of crystal, flesh, and madness.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> If the players investigate the corpse they make a DC 33 [[skills#Perception|Perception]] check.  If successful, from the ruined corpse of the Eye Tyrant the players may collect the following.
