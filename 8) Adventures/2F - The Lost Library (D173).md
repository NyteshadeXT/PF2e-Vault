# Background
Before the violent birth of the Chaos Scar, the goliath sorcerer Voran Earthmane mastered elemental magic in his isolated keep. For his most dangerous experiments, he built isolated underground chambers that could be accessed only through magical methods. He was able to experiment for several years in peace, but when the meteor struck, he lost all access to his work. After recovering what he could, Voran left, and knowledge of his work faded. 

Hesskin Flamebrow, a dwarven treasure hunter drawn to the power that lies in the valley, arrived at the Chaos Scar a few weeks ago. He and his associate met a small group of kobolds that have been abandoned by their tribe, Clan Fireclaw. In such a weakened state, these kobolds were forced to pledge their allegiance to the dwarf. As part of the bargain to save their lives, the kobold leader Nibbik claimed he knew a powerful ritual that could detect piles of gold. While this was a lie, he did know of a dragon that recently moved into the area, and it was Nibbik’s hope that by leading Hesskin to the dragon’s cave, Nibbik could defeat two potential enemies at once. 

Unfortunately for the kobolds, the dragon Kethendtir and the dragonborn Hesskin formed an alliance. Nibbik was forced to continue his treasure detecting ruse, and he and his tribe were forced to excavate further into Kethendtir’s cave. Much to the wyrmpriest’s surprise, his miners uncovered one of Voran’s lost chambers. In the few hours before the PCs arrive, Hesskin has discovered the secret of a floating lantern and opened an arcane portal that leads to Voran’s inner sanctum.

# Running the Adventure
**Total Adventure Value:** 265 xp

The adventurers make their way to the lair of the underworld dragon wyrmling Kethendtir. There, they must face the dragon almost as soon as they arrive, along with a number of kobold miners serving of the dragon. Afterward, the characters can make their way deeper into the complex, eventually finding the site of the kobolds’ excavation. They must face Gravash and Hesskin, the two dwarves who initially forced these kobold outcasts into service, along with some hostile defenses Voran left to ward his library. The characters have an opportunity to negotiate with the kobolds through Nibbik, their wyrmpriest, and make an alliance with the kobolds to provide them with intelligence on future explorations of the Chaos Scar. 

## Adventure Hooks
**Stolen Gear** 
Thorgrim Spinehammer is a dwarf in charge of a small mine close to the Chaos Scar. He recently suffered the theft of his mining equipment and tracked the thieves as far as the King’s Wall. Not willing to risk his own life by entering the valley, he offers to pay the characters 75 gp to follow the kobolds to the cave and recover twelve stolen picks. Thorgrim will pay as much as 125 gp to avoid purchasing replacement gear, but a DC 15 Diplomacy check must be made to convince the miserly dwarf to part with his money. 

**Wyrmling Raider** 
Local farmers have been losing livestock to raids performed by a underworld wyrmling dragon (Kethendtir). The farmers know that this problem will only get worse in the future, so they have banded together to solve their problem. A quiet halfling farmer named Karrie Buttonquail approaches the characters with all the money the farmers could amass: 2,618 cp. If the PCs try to bargain, she’ll reluctantly throw in her prize sheep worth 100 sp. 

Once the characters get to the cavern, read or paraphrase the following description of the wyrmling’s cave entry: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Small reptilian tracks disturb the fine sand that spills out of the secluded cave before you. A nearby pile of sharp, jagged rocks has been haphazardly piled outside of the cave. 

When the characters enter the cave, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The grass grows sparse as you approach the cave, revealing a sand-covered stone floor. A well-trodden trail leads into the darkness. The sound of metal on rock reverberates throughout the cavern. 

Characters examining the tracks outside of the cavern can make a [[skills#Perception|Perception]] Check: 
	**DC 15 Perception:** The characters find multiple kobold tracks, a couple of larger reptilian prints as wide as a dragonborn’s foot, and small tracks that appear to belong to either a drake or dragon.

# Encounter 1 - The Wyrmling's Cave
![[Pasted image 20230706224834.png]]

**Encounter Difficulty:** Severe (120 xp)
Creatures:
 - 1: [[kobold-scout|Kobold Scout]] S
 - 2: [[dark-talon-kobold|Dark Talon Kobold]] D
 - 5: [[kobold-warrior|Kobold Miners]] M
 - 1: [[young-underworld-dragon|Kethendtir]] K

```encounter
name: The Wyrmling's Cave
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 5: [[Kobold Warrior, Kobold Miner]] 
- 2: [[Dark Talon Kobold]]
- 1: [[Kobold Scout]]
- 1: [[Young Underworld Dragon, Kethendtir]]
```

This encounter establishes the kobold tribe, Kethendtir’s home, and the entry to the cavern. 

Setup Collapsing rock pile (T) 

Kethendtir doesn’t enter the battle until the start of the third round of combat. 

Two kobold dragonshields stand watch at the mouth of the first chamber. Any character that moves into the cavern must succeed at a DC 12 Stealth check (to beat the kobolds’ passive Perception) or alert the kobolds. If the characters that enter the cave succeed, the kobolds are surprised. 

If a hero succeeds at a DC 21 [[skills#Perception|Perception]] check within 3 squares of where the wyrmling has burrowed into the sand, read the following: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The ground at the cave mouth is disturbed, as if something has recently been buried below the sand. 

When Kethendtir enters the combat, roll initiative, place him at the cavern entry where indicated on the map, and read or paraphrase the following: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Sand scatters as a dragon launches itself out of the ground. Bellowing, the dragon says, “A swift death comes to those that interfere with the creation of my home.” 

## Tactics 
The dark talon kobolds hold their ground while the kobold slinger fires at the PCs from a distance. Any PC with a passive [[skills#Perception|Perception]] of 14 or greater can tell that the dark talons are surprisingly brave—they know that the wyrmling will soon come to their rescue.  The miners avoid combat.

If the battle turns sour, some of the kobold miners flee by either moving deeper into the cavern or by leaping into the hole in the floor. If a character moves next to a fleeing miner, the miner turns and flees on it's turn. If any kobolds escape through the tunnel (which is likely), the PCs cannot gain surprise in any encounter for the rest of the adventure unless they take a long rest.

Kethendtir has the arrogance of youth, and at the beginning of the combat he believes he is assured of victory. When he leaps out of the ground, the wyrmling scorches the party with his breath weapon and follows up with a coiling frenzy attack. If none of the characters are grabbed, he tries to use his kobold allies and flanking partners as he resorts to melee attacks. Once his hit points have been reduced to 15 or below, he burrows through the sand and flees into the cave, attempting to get help from his allies.

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** Hesskin has commanded the kobolds to illuminate the entire cavern because he has no natural ability to see in the dark. Several torches are crudely bolted to the walls throughout the chamber, providing bright light. 

**Rock Piles:** The kobold’s mining operations has resulted in many rock piles throughout the cavern. These piles of stone are difficult terrain. 

**Sinkhole:** In the middle of the room is a sinkhole that leads to a network of tunnels below the ground. Small creatures can squeeze through the tunnels, and creatures that are Tiny or smaller have no movement penalties. A multitude of tunnels grant fleeing kobolds many opportunities to hide, but an energetic halfling or gnome could attempt to track the miners down. For each kobold that escaped down the hole that an adventurer chases, have that character attempt a DC 10 [[skills#Survival|Survival]] check to determine if they can catch up to a miner. Success indicates the character finds a kobold and combat ensues; if the character fails, he or she is unable to find a kobold. Each attempt takes 10 minutes.

 - 2: [[kobold-warrior|Kobold Miners]] M

![[Pasted image 20230725145755.png]]

The PCs continue down a recently excavated passage and discover a well-crafted room carved out of the bedrock. Piles of rock lie by the entry to the cavern where the kobolds broke into the chamber. 

When the PCs enter the room, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> As you turn the corner, the natural walls of the passage abruptly transition into well-crafted stonework. A rock wall that sealed off the tunnel has been pushed down and now lies scattered on the floor, allowing access to a chamber illuminated by a soft blue glow. 
> 
> Two ransacked bookshelves lean against the walls of the room. The contents of the shelves have been thrown into a moldering pile on the floor. 
> 
> An antique desk sits near the middle of the room, surrounded by glowing dwarven runes carved into the floor. Behind the desk is a wooden table covered in alchemical equipment. In the far corner of the room, a humming arcane portal hovers a few inches above a glowing circle carved into the floor. 
> 
> As a small clutch of kobolds turn to face you, a dragonborn clad in leather armor unsheathes a longsword and nimbly advances, snarling. 

## Tactics 
Gravash is overconfident and does not see the PCs as a threat. He takes tactically poor decisions to show off his training: He won’t concentrate on one foe, but instead leap over one foe with end-over-end strike, and then follow up with a longsword attack against a different target. 

The dark talon kobold reluctantly joins Gravash in combat, moving into a flanking position when possible. The kobold slingers attack the PCs from behind the warded desk, using it to gain cover against the characters. The miners cower in the hallway, only emerging if they can strike at an opponent without provoking an opportunity attack. Gravash and the kobolds all know about the trapped desk and won’t willingly trigger it.

## Features of the Area 
**Illumination:** The glowing runes around the desk and magic circle illuminate the room with dim light. 

**Collapsed Wall:** The wall the kobolds broke through lies in pieces on the floor and now counts as difficult terrain. 

**Pile of Books:** The books are in very poor condition due to centuries of abuse by the elements, but with some study it can be determined that these books deal with esoteric arcane knowledge, such as the creation of magical items or the history of the Elemental Chaos. This is a good opportunity to introduce alchemical formulas or ritual books if desired for your campaign. 

If hired to recover Emeranith’s stolen books, they are found here. The books include information about the history of the local lands, especially the period before the meteor hit. 

**Desk:** The desk contains [[voran's-eternal-chalk|Voran's Eternal Chalk]], *Formula - 5 Talisman (Dupe's Gold Nugget)*, [[fearcracker-tv|Fearcracker]] and a few scraps of paper written in a goliath dialect of Dwarven. The paper is yellowed with age, but some writing can be deciphered, including a fragment from a journal: 

	It is fitting that the lantern’s elemental flame grants access to my library; only the knowledge in these books has granted me the power to tame the elements. My mastery over earth and stone continues to grow. I excavated the Tomb in record time and the portal opens perfectly when I blow the whistle. 
	
	I wish I did not need a tomb, but I’ve chased off too many grave robbers over the past few months. I could not risk Locantra’s body being stolen. I moved entire blocks of earth at once, but they are now safe deep underground—the dead shall lie in peace. 
	
	I have only one chamber left to build, but it will be the most difficult of all. I am almost finished with the key—just one final enchantment and the battle standard will be complete. 

**Caved-In Passage:** The short passage collapsed when the meteor struck, isolating the library from outside. Clearing out the tunnel would be as much work as digging a new tunnel. The end of the passage counts as difficult terrain. 

**Alchemical Bench:** Most of the ingredients on the bench are dried up and useless. PCs searching the desk are able to salvage two *Acid Flasks (Moderate)* and various alchemical reagents. 

**Portal:** The portal in the corner leads to the final room in this portion of Voran’s library, and [[04) The Inner Sanctum]] 

# Encounter 3 - The Inner Sanctum
![[Pasted image 20230725161859.png]]

**Encounter Difficulty:** Moderate (95 xp)
Creatures:
 - 2: [[kobold-scout|Kobold Scout]] S
 - 1: [[kobold-dragon-mage|Nibbik]] D
 - 1: [[carrion-golem|Carrion Golem]] A
 - 1: Hesskin (See below) G

```encounter
name: The Inner Sanctum
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 1: [[Kobold Dragon Mage, Nibbik]]
- 2: [[Kobold Scout]]
- 1: [[Carrion Golem]]
- 1: Hesskin, 138, 16, 4
```

![[Pasted image 20230725162037.png]]

This is Voran’s inner sanctum, the heart of his distributed laboratories buried deep underground. Hesskin and Nibbik only recently started exploring this chamber when the PCs interrupt them. 

When the PCs enter this room, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> As you step through the portal, you feel your bodies shifted through miles of rock in a moment that feels both instantaneous and endless. You feel your form coalesce in a rocky chamber standing in a glowing yellow circle. A hovering lantern stands a short distance away, illuminating the room. Before you is a wooden staircase leading up to the rest of the room. At the top of the stairs stands a dragonborn clad in scale next to a amalgamation of putrefied parts stitched together to form some kind of abomination.

If any of the kobolds escaped from [[02) The Wyrmling's Cave]] and the party hasn’t taken a long rest, Hesskin immediately fires a crossbow bolt at the first character that comes out of the portal, beginning combat. 

[[skills#perception|Perception]] DC 17: The character spots the rest of the kobolds. If the adventurers are unaware of the kobolds, the creatures have surprise when they make their first attack. 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Three kobolds skirt the perimeter of the room, getting ready to attack! 

## Tactics 
Hesskin prefers to start the combat by firing his crossbow from the top of the stairs, defending the supporting the carrion golom. Hesskin is patient—he won’t rush into melee until the kobold slingers, the carrion golom, or Nibbik are overwhelmed. The carrion golom guard area is the 4-square by 4-square magic circle in the middle of the room attacking only PCs in that area. 

The kobold slingers look for casters to minimize their overall effectiveness.  

Nibbik is a coward and tries to keep Hesskin between himself and the PCs. Nibbik uses incite faith early in the encounter to protect his slingers. Once Hesskin is defeated, Nibbik surrenders. He prefers to surrender to a kobold PC if possible, pledging himself and the remaining kobolds to do the heroes’ will.

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** The floating lantern [[voran's-eternal-lantern|Voren's Eternal Lantern]] (L on the map) provides bright light to all squares on the lower platform and the stairs, but the rest of the chamber is dim light. 

**Lower Platform:** The 8-square by 8-square platform with the magic circle is 2 squares below the rest of the room. The walls are difficult ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] DC 22) to climb.

**Stairs:** The stairs count as difficult terrain. 

**Portal Circle:** This circle is a link to all of Voran’s chambers. While [[voran's-eternal-lantern|Voren's Eternal Lantern]] illuminates the circle, the portal to the library remains open. If a character that searches the circle succeeds at a DC 17 [[skills#Perception|Perception]] check, they notice the ground around the circle is covered with a fine red chalk dust. Once the lantern no longer illuminates the circle, the portal closes. 

If another one of Voran’s item keys is used by the circle, a portal opens allowing access to another chamber.  [[voran's-eternal-lantern|Voren's Eternal Lantern]] creates the link to the library. If [[voran's-eternal-chalk|Voran's Eternal Chalk]] is used to draw a red line in the circle, a portal is opened to Voran’s study, in the adventure “Stick in the Mud”. The portal remains open until the party takes an long rest. 

**Hatch:** The hatch requires a DC 22 [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] check to open. Below the hatch is a set of circular stairs that lead to a small living area that provides enough room for the characters to take a long rest. The hatch can be bolted from within. The living area is enchanted, providing individual resting chambers for up to ten creatures. The name of each of the PCs is written on one of these doors. Items left in the chamber will be there when the owner returns.

## Concluding the Adventure
If the characters decide to spare Nibbik, you have the option of introducing kobolds as companion characters to the party. 

Three potential kobolds can join the group, depending on what the party needs. Nibbik, Kobold DragonMage; Minnock, Kobold Scout; Krunk One-Ear, Dark Talon Kobold. These kobolds are all members of the Fireclaw tribe. 

Nibbik is an opportunist—he sees potential in the characters. His loyalty is not absolute, and if the PCs ever face an opponent that seems able to defeat them, Nibbik will switch sides to save his own hide. He also seeks the power that a shard of the meteor would grant him—should he find one, he will attempt to seize it without a second thought. 

The PCs might choose to use Voran’s sanctum as a base of operations in the valley. No map is provided for the space below the Portal chamber, but the space should have the basic necessities for resting. If the players start using this area as a base of operations, they might be interested in outfitting the base with wondrous lair items as described on page 79 of Adventurer’s Vault 2.
