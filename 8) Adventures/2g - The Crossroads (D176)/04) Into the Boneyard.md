This encounter takes place if the characters are enticed into trying to investigate the boneyard. Several undead creatures reside here, and they lurk underground most of the time (hiding in shallow graves filled with dirt). These undead are mindless and brutish, and want only to extinguish any life that enters the boneyard.

 - 4: [[zombie-brute|Zombie Brute]] G
 - 1:  [[Zombie-Lord|Zombie Lord]] B

When the heroes enter the boneyard, read or paraphrase the following: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Scattered piles of earth and occasional small pits are all that distinguishes this pitiful graveyard from the surrounding terrain. The majority of the unmarked graves are down a slight slope, concentrated in a bowl-shaped depression in the valley. 
> Perception 
> DC 10 The character notices that some of the bodies that lie stacked in open graves are occasionally moving of their own accord. 
> DC 15 The character notices that some of the mounds of earth are shifting, and that something might be lurking beneath. 

# Tactics
The four zombie brutes begin in hiding, lurking in the mounds of earth and making Stealth checks to remain unnoticed. Once the characters are within the area, they emerge from hiding and try and drag characters into shallow graves. The zombie lord will hang back and look for opportunities to bring more zombies into the encounter. 

# Features of the Area 
**Illumination:** During the daytime, there is little to obscure the sunlight, so the boneyard is well lit. At night, light from the trading post (and the moon, if present) illuminates the graveyard, casting the entire area in dim light. 

**Ground:** The ground here is soft and covered in mounts of dirt. All squares filled by these dirt mounds count as difficult terrain. 

**Shallow Graves:** A number of [[shallow-grave-hb|Shallow Graves]] leave holes in the ground throughout the boneyard. Each of these three shallow graves is marked on the map as an empty hole in the ground, and is 1 square deep.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> Searching the zombies the players can find 50 gp and 25 sp.  Additionally the Zombie Lord has *Crystal Shards (Moderate).*
