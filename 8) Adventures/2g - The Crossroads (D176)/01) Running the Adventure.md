Just beyond the remnants of the King’s Wall, at the edge of the Chaos Scar, a dirt path leads from civilization into the heart of this dangerous valley. Right off the edge of this path sits a place known to travelers as the Crossroads (though, in truth, only the one path passes through this area). Here, at the edge of the Chaos Scar, is where the fringes of civilization and the edge of danger meet. Not coincidentally, this is also the place where those brave enough to venture even just inside the edge of the Chaos Scar come to meet with some of the more entrepreneurial inhabitants of the valley. It is just distant enough from the closest settlements and bastions of order that those of less honorable origin can come to sell their wares and services. And it is likewise just far enough from the Chaos Scar that those seeking such wares and services can come without too much fear of trouble—although this is still a lawless area. It is a rough place, like the Scar beyond it, but this waypoint is used by many adventurers (and the bravest of merchants and traders) as a final stopping place before entering the Chaos Scar proper.

# The Gibbet Tree
Riding into the Crossroads, the first sight to greet a visitor’s eyes is the massive structure known as the gibbet tree. This tall, metal structure has a number of bars that branch off from a thick, metal central post, from which hang a number of broad metal cages. Many of the intelligent monstrous races that live within the confines of the Chaos Scar use the gibbet tree as a form of punishment and a warning to anyone who would consider entering their domain. Hobgoblins, orcs, gnolls, and other races inhabiting the Scar bring live captives to the Crossroads and stuff them within the cages of the gibbet tree, where they are left to die a slow, agonizing death from thirst and starvation. 

When the characters first arrive at the Crossroads, they will almost certainly see the gibbet tree immediately, as all visitors entering from civilization do. The gibbet tree serves as a warning that anyone thinking of entering the Chaos Scar had best turn back, because intruders are dealt with harshly.

## Cries for Help
When the heroes approach, they will find that they have arrived while a prisoner, [[Ardia Ironleaf - Ironleaf Trading Co.]] in the gibbet tree is begging her captors for her life. Should the heroes try to intervene, the hobgoblin guards stationed there do not take kindly to their meddling.  If they choose to ignore it, they must listen to the prisoner’s cries for the duration of their stay at the Crossroads. 

If the characters do come to the prisoner’s rescue, they must deal with the hobgoblins. See the “[[02) Hobgoblin Hangman]]” encounter below for how to deal with this situation. If the characters manage to rescue the prisoner, he is not only very grateful but offers to lead the characters back into the valley to recover the bodies of his former companions

# The Trading Post
The main structure, and the reason why most visitors come to the Crossroads, is the trading post that has been erected there. A two-story building that looks vaguely like a mushroom, with a second floor wider than the first, this building looks old and appears to be in ill repair. Most of the wood has grayed from constant exposure to the elements, and most of the shutters on the windows have large holes punched in them, if they haven’t simply rotted away. A sign above the door depicts a wagon being drawn by oxen, the only indication this is more than just an abandoned building. 

This trading post is where brave merchants from civilization come to deal with the monstrous races of the Chaos Scar. Many adventurers who meet their end in the Chaos Scar leave behind magic and unique items, which the inhabitants of the valley are only happy to sell or trade to unscrupulous merchants. The traders get their hands on magic items, and the monsters get their hands on contraband smuggled by the traders. All such details occur at the Crossroads.

## Fulgrim, Pelt Trader 
Fulgrim has currently brought a collection of thick behemoth hides to trade with a caravan of dwarves; the dwarves expect to use the hides to make armor before an expedition deeper into the Chaos Scar.

# The Boneyard
Away from the main road is a sunken depression in the earth known as the boneyard. This is where the remains of bodies from the gibbet tree are tossed when a cage needs to be cleaned out for a new occupant. The boneyard is a crude graveyard full of unmarked graves, shallow pits, and mounds of freshly churned earth. The necrotic energy from so many tortured bodies has given unlife to a number of zombies that now roam the boneyard, hungry for the flesh of the living. 

## The Treasure Trap
One of [[Millen Silvereye]]’s favorite schemes involves using the boneyard as a trap for the greedy. The ruse begins when new traders or naïve adventurers arrive at the Crossroads looking for contraband or black market magic items. If Millen believes he can fool them, he pretends to barter for a number of magic items until he has come to an agreement with the traders. With the deal done, Millen provides the traders with a map of the boneyard, claiming that, to keep from being killed and robbed, he keeps his valuables buried in empty graves in the boneyard. With the supposed location of these hiding places marked on the map, he sends them off to the boneyard, where the zombies waiting there invariably kill the traders. Millen waits until the zombies’ hunger is sated before going into the boneyard to recover any valuables the victims might have carried. 

Millen will try to trick the characters into falling into his trap, even if he has to sell them a few items first to win their confidence. He doesn’t care about giving away a few items, since he plans to reclaim them once the zombies have finished with the characters. See the [[04) Into the Boneyard]] encounter, and then the [[03) Inside the Trading Post]] encounter if the characters return to confront Millen.

> # Getting Black Market Access
> 
> You try to convince Millen Silvereye to sell you some of the black market goods hidden at the Crossroads trading post.
> 
> When the characters arrive at the trading post, they should catch on that more than just pelt trading goes on here. In fact, the dwarves of the caravan seem a bit unnerved by the presence of adventurers, as though afraid of being caught dealing with Millen. He clearly has more to offer than simple appraisal.

> **Secondary Skills:** 
> 
> ### Primary Skills
> **Diplomacy (DC 15, 1 success):** The character appeals to Millen’s business sense, convincing him that they will make good (and discrete) customers and that he should deal with them.
> 
> **Perception (Insight) (DC 15, 1 success):**  The character senses Millen’s caution and reluctance, and knows to convince Millen that he won’t bring any trouble to the trading post.
> 
> **Intimidation (DC 20, 1 success):** The character tries to convince Millen that refusing them would be very bad for his health. Millen’s reluctance begins to melt away when he realizes that they could probably just take what they wanted.
> 
> **Thievery (DC 15, 1 success):** The character recognizes that dealing in black market goods requires a certain attitude and approach, which usually involves talking around the subject of the conversation rather than speak of it directly. The character knows the lingo that Millen expects a discrete buyer to use.
> 
> ### Secondary Skills
> **Perception or Bluff (DC 13, no successes):** The character notices (or tricks Millen into revealing) that no one expected them to arrive, and that the characters may have interrupted some clandestine trading. This grants the character a +2 bonus to Perception or Thievery checks for the remainder of the skill challenge.
> 
> ### Success
> The characters convince Millen to let them see his secret wares. Millen offers up two magic items for sale at 90% of market price. These magic items are all level 3 or lower, chosen by the DM. He also tries to trick the characters with his favorite scheme (see  [[04) Into the Boneyard]]).
> 
> ### Failure 
> Millen does not offer the characters any of his real wares, but instead only pretends to deal with them, attempting to lure them into his scheme (see [[04) Into the Boneyard]]).
