This encounter may occur whenever the characters investigate the gibbet tree and decide to intervene. The hobgoblins have recently captured a human thief who tried to rob their base of operations deeper in the valley. They brought the thief here to face a slow, agonizing death. The captive is still alive, but the three hobgoblin deathwatchers assigned to guard the gibbet tree are tiring of his begging. If the heroes decide to intervene and free the man, the hobgoblins try to stop them. Alternatively, this scene could occur if the heroes are captured in the valley and brought here to be put in the gibbet tree themselves.

> The sound of harsh words spoken in a guttural language nearly drowns out the cries for mercy coming from ahead. Looming over the path is what appears to be a massive metal frame resembling a tree, from which hang a number of metal cages. Rotting corpses occupy most of the cages, though a malnourished elven prisoner reaches out from between the bars of one cage, pleading with three stern looking hobgoblins to set her free. 

# Tactics
The hobgoblins are deathwatchers, set in place to ensure that prisoners left in the gibbets die the slow, agonizing deaths they deserve. They fight to prevent anyone from intervening in the punishment of captives, and they try and drive enemies away from the cages, or slay them if they are persistent. They have been letting the ravens feed on the corpses, so if anyone starts a fight with the hobgoblins the raven swarms come to the rescue. The hobgoblins are also aware of the gibbet zombies, and if an enemy tries to get close they sometimes allow the zombies to grab those enemies before hitting them with prisoner’s lament. 

# Features of the Area
**Illumination:** During the daytime, there is little to obscure the sunlight, so the area around the gibbet tree is well lit. At night, light from the trading post (and the moon, if present) illuminates the gibbets, casting the entire area in dim light. 

**Gibbet Tree:** The gibbet tree is a massive metal structure designed to hold the gibbets in the air, keeping them around 5 feet off of the ground. The tree’s frame is made of thick black iron, and has lasted for many years without bending or rusting appreciably. 

**Ground:** The ground below the gibbet tree is covered in filth and muck, but, like the rest of the area, should provide no significant impediment.
