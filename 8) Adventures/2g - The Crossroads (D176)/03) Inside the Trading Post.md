This encounter takes place if the heroes try and bully [[Fulgrim]] and the dwarves into letting them in on the black market dealings, or it could occur when the heroes confront [[Millen Silvereye]] after he tries to direct them into an ambush in the boneyard. Since the dwarves and  [[Fulgrim]] have business together, they fight together, and they will defend [[Millen Silvereye]] if the characters try to rough up the tiefling appraiser.

When the characters first enter the trading post, read or paraphrase the following: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The inside of this building looks to be only marginally cleaner than the wilderness outside. The ground floor of the building is host to a wide open area where several benches are arrayed for the display of wares. A group of dwarves is picking through what looks to be animal hides on one table, while a weathered half-orc watches them closely. A lithe tiefling man with the hood of his robe pulled up turns to look at you as you enter, gazing at you with what appears to be one eye made completely of silver. 

# Tactics 
When a fight breaks out, the caravan guards move into positions where they can use focused guard on Fulgrim, Millen, and their caravan master respectively. Millen tends to stay near the rear of the conflict or ascend to the second floor, psychically hurling small objects such as lanterns, pewter mugs, and coins like projectile weapons at the characters. Fulgrim tries to catch any characters that stay too close to the edge of the fight with his hook and hold attack, using them as a human shield while letting the dwarves do the bulk of the fighting. If the caravan guards get too far from their charges, the caravan master uses caravan driver to get them back into proper position. 

# Features of the Area 
**Illumination:** The interior of the trading post is kept lit at all times by a variety of lanterns, candles, and a fire in the hearth. It is brightly lit throughout. 

**Ground:** The ground is little more than a dirt floor covered in a layer of dry straw. An errant torch or broken lantern could set the floor, and the rest of the trading post, on fire. 

**Second Floor:** A single set of stairs leads to a second floor, where a number of pallets are kept for travelers who need to stay overnight. The second floor is two squares up from the ground floor.
