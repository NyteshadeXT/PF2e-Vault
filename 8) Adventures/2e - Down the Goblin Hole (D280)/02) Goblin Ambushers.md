The goblin snipers are in the trees, 15 feet above the ground. The deathjump spider also starts in the trees but jumps down to join the fight as soon as battle begins. 

**If the characters failed or did not attempt the “Ambushing the Ambushers” skill check, then read the following aloud before setting up the encounter.** 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> As you make your way through the forest, you spot something glistening between two trees. It’s a strand of spider web, so thin as to be almost invisible if it were not for some droplets of dew. Looking more closely, you realize that there’s a full web stretching between those two trees ... and the trees next to them. You’re hemmed in on all sides by webbing. It’s a trap! 

The characters start in the web-covered area at the bottom of the map. If a character tries to move out of this area, then he must make a DC20 Athletics check or be restrained (save ends). 

**If the characters succeeded in the skill check, read the following section aloud instead.** 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Just in time, you spot a cunningly hidden spider web stretching between two trees. You cautiously make your way around the web and find several other, similar webs between other trees. You came close to falling into someone’s trap... 

In this case, the characters start in the open beyond the web-covered area. 

# Tactics
The goblin snipers stay in the trees and keep firing, targeting characters caught in the spider web if possible. If the characters get too close, they move through the trees to keep out of melee range. 

The vine lashers stay in the middle of the battlefield and use their impaling thorns and pulling vines to drag grabbed characters back toward the bottom of the map, away from the snipers. The vines attack melee characters first. 

The deathjump spider uses its death from above attack to move quickly around the battlefield. Ideally, it knocks down the character nearest to the goblins to give the vine lashers a chance to grab and drag that character. If none of the heroes are close to the goblins, then the deathjump spider tries to set up flanking attacks with the spiderlings and vines. When surrounded, it uses prodigious leap to flee back to the safety of the trees. 

# Development 
A clear trail leads off from the ambush site toward the Goblin Hole. 

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> Searching the webbed copse of trees turns up the corpse of another adventurer who wandered into the trap and starved to death. His body has been sucked dry by the spiders, but his equipment is still intact. Characters can salvage a longsword, leather armor, and 45 gold pieces from the corpse.

# Features of the Area
**Illumination:** It’s daylight. 

**Trees:** The goblin snipers have concealment thanks to the foliage of the trees, giving a -2 penalty to attack rolls targeting them. They are 15 feet off the ground, so they can only be hit by ranged attacks or weapons with Reach. Climbing a tree requires a DC 15 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] skill check. The trees are so close together that their branches have interwoven, allowing characters to move between adjacent trees without needing to climb back down. The trees are considered difficult terrain. 

**Webs:** One copse of trees is covered in sticky webs that trap creatures who blunder in, making that copse into a potential killing ground if characters did not succeed at the “Ambushing the Ambushers” skill challenge; see above.
