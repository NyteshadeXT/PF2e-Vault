# Adventure Hooks
There are several ways to get the characters involved in this adventure. 

**Get a Job**
Kendon Longstrider, posts a request and reward of 50 gp on the local job board to have a band of adventurers clear out the Goblin Hole.  See the Restwell Jobs section.

**Raiders**
Goblin raiders were sighted east of the King’s Wall. Traditionally, the goblins have used the Goblin Hole as a base in that area. Someone should investigate the hole and find out how the goblins were able to cross the wall so easily. (They scaled the wall on the backs of their spider minions.) Worryingly, some of the goblins were shouting the name Urgog as a battle-cry. 

**Divinations**
Magical divinations by Chendera, the half-elf cleric who oversees the temple of Tymora at Restwell Keep, point to the existence of some growing threat in the depths of the woods. Unless stopped, this threat may grow too powerful to be dealt with easily, so heroes must put an end to it quickly. She advises the characters to seek out the rumored “Goblin Hole” and begin investigating there. 

**Hapless Adventurer**
Another adventurer encountered a band of goblins crossing through the lands east of the Scar. These goblins were pushing a crudely-made cart laden with swords, helmets, and other booty. The adventurer captured one of the goblins and questioned the wretch, who revealed that the cart was “tribute for Urgog the Mangler, King of the Goblin Hole.

# Getting Started 
## Research
A [[skills#Society|Society]] roll (DC15) or consulting with local greybeards (such as the silver-masked mage [[Ailwin|Ailwin]] at Restwell Keep) lets the characters find out that Urgog was once a feared goblin warlord, but no one has heard of him in more than ten years. 

## Down the Goblin Hole 
After crossing the King’s Wall, the characters travel into the woodlands in the south of the Chaos Scar. The forests here are thick and dark, with few clear trails. In places, the trees are strangely twisted and mutated by the malign influence of the Scar. Initially, the adventurers do not encounter any threatening beasts, but they cannot escape the feeling that they are being watched by inhuman eyes in the dark of the woods. 

## Goblin Ambush 
> [!tip]+ Skill Challenge - Ambushing the Ambushers
> As they approach the Goblin Hole, characters see signs of the goblins—footprints, discarded arrowheads, small paths cut through the underbrush, and the stumps of smaller trees cut down for firewood. If the characters blunder on through the woods, then they automatically run into the goblin ambush (Encounter 1). If they proceed carefully, run the optional skill challenge, Ambushing the Ambushers.
