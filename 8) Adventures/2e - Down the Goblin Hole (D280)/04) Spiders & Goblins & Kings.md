**Encounter Difficulty:** Severe (140 xp)

# The Bottom of the Hole 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> After slipping and sliding through three smaller chambers, you arrive at a larger cave. In the center of the floor is a large hole which leads into a still deeper cavern. Crude rope ladders are tied to stalagmites that dangle into the hole, and you can see torchlight from below. A voice roars from beneath you. ‘I am Urgog the Mangler, Urgog the war-chief, the King of the Goblin Hole! Come down and fight! Come down and die!’ After a momentary pause, the voice says ‘are you sure they’re up there? I can’t hear anything!’ 

A [[skills#Perception|perception]] check (DC15) lets the characters hear a strange, chittering noise: the speech of the shard spider assuring Urgog that the adventurers are indeed close at hand. It’s impossible to use missile attacks to strike at Urgog or his guards from the upper cavern, so the characters must climb down the ladders to slay the goblin chieftain. 

Place the following foes on the map at the start of the encounter: 
 - 2: [[goblin-warrior|Goblin Cutthroat]] G
 - 1: [[shard-spider|Shard Spider]] F
 - 1: [[goblin-underboss|Urgog]] U 

```encounter
name: Spiders & Goblins & Kings 2
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 2: [[Goblin Warrior, Goblin Cutthroat]] 
- 1: [[Shard Spider]]
- 1: [[Goblin Underboss, Urgog]]
```

On round four, add the following foes:
 - 4: [[goblin-warrior|Goblin Cutter]]
 - 1: [[goblin-warrior|Goblin Warrior]]

```encounter
name: Spiders & Goblins & Kings 2
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 4: [[Goblin Warrior, Goblin Cutter]] 
- 1: [[Goblin Warrior]]
```

The player characters start in the middle of the cavern. 

# Tactics
Urgog keeps his two cutthroat henchmen close by at all times. The three gang up on the most dangerous foes, using goblin tactics to stay in flanking positions so the cutthroats have combat advantage. 

The shard spider keeps moving and attacking.

On round 2, 4 goblin cutters and 1 goblin warrior arrive in the upper chamber. They act as follows: 

**Round 2:** Push rocks down from above. These goblins working together make a single rockslide attack as described below. The attack occurs on the slowest of the goblins’ initiative points. It is centered on the square marked X on the map. 

**Round 3:** The goblins make another rockslide attack. 

**Round 4:** The goblins swing down on ropes from the upper chamber and attack. The momentum of swinging down on a rope counts as a charge. They move to link up with Urgog if he is still alive. Otherwise, they just attack the nearest enemies. 

# Development 
The shard of the meteor discovered by Urgog is lodged in the webs of the spider. The characters can cut it free from the webs and take it with them. Its specific properties and hazards are up to you, depending on what plans you have for further developments and what measures the characters take to protect themselves. 

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> In addition the the [[striking|+1 Striking Shortsword]] used by Urgog.  His treasure hoard is in a chest under his throne. It consists of [[sarkorian-god-caller-garb-lotgb|Sarkorian God-caller Garb]], [[heartening-missive-rabbit-tv|Heartening Missive (Rabbit)]], [[eidetic-potion-tv|Eidetic Potion]] and 34 gold pieces. 

# Features of the Area
**Illumination:** The webs of the phase spider glow dimly on the walls, providing dim illumination. 

**Ceilings:** The ceiling of this chamber is 15 feet high. Ropes and Ladders: These aren’t shown on the map. They hang from the upper chamber to the lower one, allowing a character to drop into any of the 16 outlined squares.
