# Tactics
Urgog keeps his two cutthroat henchmen close by at all times. The three gang up on the most dangerous foes, using goblin tactics to stay in flanking positions so the cutthroats have combat advantage. 

The shard spider keeps moving and attacking.

On round 2, 4 goblin cutters and 1 goblin warrior arrive in the upper chamber. They act as follows: 

**Round 2:** Push rocks down from above. These goblins working together make a single rockslide attack as described below. The attack occurs on the slowest of the goblins’ initiative points. It is centered on the square marked X on the map. 

**Round 3:** The goblins make another rockslide attack. 

**Round 4:** The goblins swing down on ropes from the upper chamber and attack. The momentum of swinging down on a rope counts as a charge. They move to link up with Urgog if he is still alive. Otherwise, they just attack the nearest enemies. 

# Development 
The shard of the meteor discovered by Urgog is lodged in the webs of the spider. The characters can cut it free from the webs and take it with them. Its specific properties and hazards are up to you, depending on what plans you have for further developments and what measures the characters take to protect themselves. 

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> In addition the the *+1 Striking Shortsword* used by Urgog.  His treasure hoard is in a chest under his throne. It consists of *Sarkorian God-Caller Garb*, *Heartening Missive (Rabbit)*, *Eidetic Potion* and 34 gold pieces. 

# Features of the Area
**Illumination:** The webs of the phase spider glow dimly on the walls, providing dim illumination. 

**Ceilings:** The ceiling of this chamber is 15 feet high. Ropes and Ladders: These aren’t shown on the map. They hang from the upper chamber to the lower one, allowing a character to drop into any of the 16 outlined squares.
