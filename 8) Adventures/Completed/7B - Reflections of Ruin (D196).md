# Background
The red dragon Maluriath was once a vain creature who spent as much time lounging atop her treasure hoard as most dragons devote to gathering followers and scheming. When she chose to expand her hoard by raiding settlements, she worked in concert with her brother, Mekkalath, who was more concerned with finding a proper lair and amassing a cadre of suitably subservient underlings. 

Their concerted efforts reaped considerable rewards, but eventually Mekkalath did bring some followers to his side, and then he grew tired of dividing the spoils of their raids with his sister. He schemed to attack the ruins of Gardmore Abbey, a place rife with forgotten treasures as well as potential henchmen, and brought Maluriath along without telling her the full extent of his plans. When he subjugated the creatures there, Mekkalath revealed to his sister that the abbey was his new lair and that he now intended to conduct his affairs without her. 

Maluriath did not react immediately, realizing that it would be foolish to challenge her brother directly while his newly acquired followers surrounded him. She decided to use stealthier tactics to try to undermine his domain. She combed the abbey for the relic that the lost paladins had once hoped to contain: the Deck of Many Things. Worried that one of her brother’s cronies might discover her, she drew hastily upon the deck’s powers but failed to gain the help she wanted. As the deck overpowered Maluriath with chaotic energy, her betrayal became apparent to her brother, turning him against her and causing him to send forces to secure her hoard. She also came to the attention of a notoriously spiteful corruptor of the Nine Hells, who twisted her body into a wretched and vile form. Maluriath is unsure how she came to the devil’s attention, but chaotic forces from the Deck of Many Things now combine with the devil’s curse to wrack her with constant pain. 

Ashamed of her new form and barely sane due to the painful energy overwhelming her, Maluriath fled her brother’s domain and, in time, sought out the Chaos Scar, a place whose corruption called to her. She intended to make her lair in the forgotten depths of a dormant volcano by ousting the ogres that occupied the caves in the area. The ugly creatures suited her temperament, however, so she cowed them into servitude instead and used several of them as a repository for some of the energy that pained her greatly. 

In her attempts to break the devil’s curse of corruption, Maluriath thought the solution could be found in the creation of special arcane mirrors, but she had no success. When she placed a test subject near one of the mirrors, she hoped the mirror would give off a twisted reflection of the creature’s actual appearance. Then she would turn the reflection into truth, causing the creature to take on some of the cursed energy inside her. Instead, no matter how many mirrors she tried, her test subjects kept morphing into hideous aberrations, but without any change in her own condition. 

After failure upon failure, Maluriath changed the direction of her research. Instead of attempting to return to what she once was, she decided to visit the same twisted changes she had experienced upon the world around her to create a warped domain for herself.

# Running the Adventure
- **Job Board**[[Ailwin]] has acquired a piece of obsidian with strange properties. He wants a group to find a cave deep in the Scar and bring him back more of it for examination. He will pay 1,000 gold for this. (Reflections of Ruin)
- **A Rogue's Find** Thanks to the efforts of a treasure-hunting rogue, [[Ailwin]] of the Saruun Guildhouse is in possession of a polished fragment of obsidian that casts eerie reflections. [[Ailwin]] is curious about the obsidian’s origin (the rogue told him it came from a cave deep within the Chaos Scar) and is willing to pay 100 gp for similar objects.
- **Ill Omens** [[Chendera]] has seen ill omens and senses that world-changing corruption is building within the Chaos Scar. She hopes that a band of adventurers can succeed in investigating and destroying this evil before Lord Drysdale conscripts people and marches into the valley en masse.
- **Fool the Ogre** Assuming [[Fool]] the ogre survived "Scarred for Life,” he entreats the PCs aid in freeing his former tribe from the dragon’s enslavement. He asks the characters to fight past his kin, sparing as many as possible, to defeat Maluriath. Fool promises to lead the tribe away from human settlements, but it is up to you whether the cunning ogre makes good on his word.

> [!warning]
> **Maluriath’s Ogres**
> Each ogre the characters come up against in this adventure has a special power associated with a card from the Deck of Many Things and a unique name that is the same as the card’s. Be sure to become familiar with the roleplaying aspects of each ogre, as well as the special powers, before you run an encounter. 
> 
> In naming the ogres after the cards and branding her minions with images of the deck, Maluriath unknowingly imbued part of the artifact’s chaotic powers upon them. (Such was the case with [[Fool]], who became a wild card in his tribe and escaped.) As the adventurers battle the ogres, intimations of the powers of the Deck of Many Things become noticeable. The ogres have little understanding of why this power manifests. 
> 
> Beyond the ogres’ special powers, the chaotic spark that has touched them has also altered their original view of the world. An unexpected cunning enhances the brutal essence of many, and others have more radical changes. Adventurers might parlay in an attempt to win over some of their foes, since Maluriath has not been a kind taskmaster. If they do so, the ogres might back down from a fight, but they are unwilling to face Maluriath in her lair (Encounter 4). 
> 
> For the purpose of characters getting information from the ogres, through voluntary means or otherwise, use the description of the particular ogre as a starting point for roleplaying the interaction. In addition to giving a basic description of the cavern system’s layout, an ogre can provide one or more of the following clues about the dragon and her lair. 
> - A devil cursed Maluriath after she used forbidden magic, and the dragon has been seeking to undo the curse ever since. 
> - Maluriath made the ogres excavate the stone from around the cave’s obsidian deposits in an effort to make dark mirrors. The ogres have no idea what the dark mirrors are for. 
> - The dragon wasted perfectly good meals (wildlife, goblins, and stray travelers) by putting them in front of her mirrors and turning them into “uglies,” which is the ogres’ term for foulspawn.
> - The ogres finished their mining and polishing efforts on a very big mirror three days ago. Maluriath has been preoccupied in front of that mirror ever since then, but she murmurs about “making the valley mine.

# Encounter 1: Dumb and Ugly
**Encounter Difficulty:**   
- [x] Moderate (80 XP) Level 12

![[7B - Reflections of Ruin _D196_-1743353975095.webp|right]]

When the adventurers reach the cave mouth (on the far eastern edge of the map), they hear Maluriath’s ritual chanting and ogres bickering over food. If the party attempts a stealthy approach, the characters must succeed on a DC 23 group [[skills#Stealth|Stealth]] check. If more than half the characters fail their checks, the dragon notices the heroes, and she bellows a warning. Otherwise, she begins shouting after characters engage the ogres in combat or conversation. 

When the heroes enter the cave, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The air within the cave is filled with smoke and the odor of burned meat. Rough stone walls enclose a spacious cavern illuminated by a cook fire tended by a ruddy-skinned ogre, who is completely enthralled by the crackling flames. Nearby, three more ogres argue over a badly scorched chunk of meat. 
> 
> Farther inside, smooth black surfaces of polished obsidian reflect warped images of the fire and ogres, as well as something from deeper within the cave. A strange, clawed limb and a portion of a large, toothy maw are apparent, but a complete image of the creature or creatures never forms. Walls and floors around these obsidian mirrors have a peculiar, scaly pattern. The stone heaves rhythmically, in time with a gurgling chant. 
> 
> Misshapen humanoids skulk in the shadows. 

When Maluriath notices the characters, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A gurgling voice emanates from the cavern’s walls. “What twist of fate brought you to despoil my triumph? The deck? The devil? It matters not. This time I shall succeed, and the creatures in this valley will learn to adore their new queen, Maluriath!” 
> 
> A pair of milky white eyes flickers within several of the mirrors. Other mirrors provide glimpses of braziers etched with arcane markings and burning with multihued flames. “Talons, Void, Flames—I have no further need of test subjects, so slay them all. Idiot—close the gate! I want no interruptions!” 
> 
> Three ogres turn their gap-toothed grins toward you as they heft their clubs. Another, holding an axe, stares slack-jawed at a rope that leads to two wooden portcullises at either end of the cavern. Strange, ghostly images flicker around their rough, filthy hides. 

Give the heroes a moment to interact with Maluriath. She harangues and taunts the adventurers before returning to her ritual. The adventurers might periodically catch a glimpse of part of the dragon’s strange shape in a mirror. Enhance the mystery of what they are facing rather than reveal what Maluriath is. 

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 4: [[ogre-soldier|Ogre Soldier]] I,T,V,F

```encounter
name: Dumb and Ugly
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 1: [[Ogre Soldier, Flames]] 
- 1: [[Ogre Soldier, Idiot]] 
- 1: [[Ogre Soldier, Talon]] 
- 1: [[Ogre Soldier, Void]]
```

Call attention to the brands and the strange effects surrounding the ogres. The brutes are also communicative, displaying cunning and personality, so take the opportunity to roleplay. 

> [!Special Powers]
> The ogres in this encounter are named Flames, Idiot, Talons, and Void. Each one’s personality and special power is described below. Each of these special powers requires an action to use. 
> 
> **Flames:** As his name suggests, Flames has an obsessive fascination with fire, and he is responsible for maintaining the cooking fire in this room. The flames that billow forth enthrall him, although anyone who can manipulate fire attracts his interest. Flames can add more fire to the mix by calling up a circle of flame to scorch everyone nearby.

> - **Success:** Half damage, no persistent fire
> - **Critical Success:** No damage
> ```
> 
> **Idiot:** Although many of the other ogres under Maluriath’s sway have an unusual clarity of thought, Idiot lives up to his name. He is easily manipulated and duped. If Idiot realizes that someone has played a trick on him, however, he erupts into a rage. In combat, this rage flows through him to his weapon in red waves of light, allowing him to befuddle his enemies.

> - **Miss:** Idiot becomes [[conditions#Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] and [[conditions#Slowed|Slowed 1]] instead of the target
> ```
> 
> **Talons:** Talons relishes theft, cruelty, and bullying. Due to his mean streak, many of his fellow ogres dislike him, but he doesn’t care. During combat, he sometimes snatches at a creature with his clawed hands, and gold-limned brown fog engulfs the creature momentarily.

> ```
> 
> **Void:** Occasionally disappearing for hours at a time with no recollection of where he has been, Void is the “strange one” that the other ogres shun. He is highly introspective and has an intense phobia of creatures that teleport or otherwise vanish from where they once stood. As a result, he avoids being near the foulspawn. When in combat, his eyes glow with painfully bright white light, and his intense stare can cause those he faces to scream in anguish.

> - **Success:** Half damage, and the target is not banished

## Tactics
Unless the adventurers engage Idiot in combat quickly, he cuts the rope that drops the portcullises in place. Flames remains close to the cooking fire and takes any opportunity to push foes into it. Talons closes with the heroes and tries to maneuver them to the ledge, grabbing them before trying to toss them down to the cavern floor. Void steers clear of the wretches as he fights, using his special power on any character who deals him a lot of damage.

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** Bright light from the fire. If the fire is extinguished, daylight spilling through the cave entrance provides dim light.
**Cooking Fire:** This fire is difficult terrain. Any creature that enters the fire or starts its turn there takes 20 fire damage. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.
**Dark Mirrors:** The warped ground adjacent to the mirrors resembles dragon scales that can move underfoot. This ground is difficult terrain. A non-aberrant creature that starts its turn adjacent to a dark mirror takes 15 psychic damage. Attacks can shatter a mirror (AC 5, Reflex 5, Fortitude 10; hp 20), negating its effects.
**Ledge:** It is a 10-foot drop from this ledge to the lower cavern floor, and a climb up ([[skills#Athletics]] DC 26). Openings from the ledge to the lower floor are gradual downward slopes.
**Portcullises:** Severing the rope suspending the two portcullises takes an action. Each wooden portcullis is difficult to force upward ([[skills#Athletics]] DC 33), but up to three characters can assist. A character can also climb up 15 feet to grab the severed rope ([[skills#Athletics]] DC 26 to climb the walls). Having the rope reduces the DC to raise a portcullis to 26, and four characters can assist.

If the characters explore this area, they can learn the following information here. When the heroes proceed west beyond the portcullis, move on to Encounter 2. 
**Mirrors:** If the adventurers investigate the mirrors, the party begins to sense Maluriath’s plan.
**[[skills#Nature|Nature]]** A DC 31 results tells the PC that the obsidian occurs naturally due to volcanic activity, but it has been carefully shaped and polished.
**[[skills#Arcana|Arcana]]** With a DC 31 result the PC can see that a mirror can channel eldritch energy into the surrounding area. These mirrors are reflecting energy so that it alters the terrain.  If the [[skills#Arcana|Arcana]]
check is DC 36 or higher they can detect that a mirror more carefully crafted than the ones here might have the power to warp natural humanoids into hideous aberrations.
**Ogre Brands:** Each ogre’s brand is unique, and a student of magic or an adventurer familiar with games might recognize the symbols of the Deck of Many Things ([[skills#Arcana|Arcana]]  DC 36).

Three of Maluriath’s ogres stand ready to assail the party as it emerges from the tunnel on the east edge of the map. Donjon stands directly ahead of the characters in plain view. All four wretches are on the battlefield when the encounter begins.

As the heroes approach, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The wide passage descends steeply. Although the caverns obviously formed naturally, scattered rubbish is a telltale sign of the presence of ogres. Rough-hewn ceiling timbers span erected intermittently throughout the chamber help to support the walls and the roof. Phosphorescent lichen clings to these beams and provides enough illumination to dimly light the area. 
> 
> In the wider corridor to your left, an ogre stands half-slumped against the wall, his chest rising and falling slowly. A snort erupts from his nose as he shifts his bulk slightly, but he does not appear to be fully awake.

If the characters are suspicious, allow a DC 36 [[skills#Perception|Perception]] check to spot Donjon’s eyes twitching as he hides the fact that he’s watching the characters. Donjon sticks to his “asleep at his post” ruse unless he comes under attack, because he hopes to lure as many adventurers as he can into a cave-in.

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 3: [[ogre-soldier|Ogre Soldier]] W
 - 4: [[foulspawn-mangler]] H

```encounter
name: Perilous Passages
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 1: [[Ogre Soldier, Balance]] 
- 1: [[Ogre Soldier, Donjon]] 
- 1: [[Ogre Soldier, Euryale]] 
- 4: [[Foulspawn Mangler]]
```

```encounter-table
name: Foulspwan Mangler
creatures:
  - 1: Foulspwan Mangler
```

> [!Special Powers]
> The ogres in this encounter are named Balance, Donjon, and Euryale. Each one’s personality and special power is described below. Each of these special powers requires a standard action to use.
> 
> **Balance:** A peculiar ogre with a moody temperament, Balance switches sides in arguments and manipulates others without thinking twice. A silver mist sometimes wraps around him and a foe when they’re in combat, making the foe’s thought processes hazy and subject to Balance’s influence.
> 
> ```ad-embed-ability 
> title: *Reversal of Will* **Activate** [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") envision
> **Requirements**: Balance must be wielding a weapon.
> **Frequency**: This ability recharges at the beginning of Balance’s turn if the last use resulted in a failure or worse (i.e., the target was affected).
> **Effect**: Balance targets one creature within 30 feet, attempting to override its will through psychic influence. A shimmering silver mist momentarily envelops them both. The target must attempt a DC 30 Will save.
> - **Critical Failure:** The target is _dominated_ as per the Dominate spell for 1 round, and after the effect ends, Balance becomes _dominated_ by the target for 1 round as an aftereffect.
> - **Failure:** The target is _dominated_ as per the Dominate spell for 1 round.  
> - **Success:** The target is [[conditions#Stupefied|Stupefied 1]].
> - **Critical Success:** The target is unaffected, and Balance is [[conditions#Stunned|Stunned 1]]
> 
> **Note**: Treat the aftereffect as if the target has a mental leash on Balance for the duration—it may issue a simple telepathic command at the start of Balance’s turn while the domination is active.
> ```
> 
> **Donjon:** This ogre feels a strange bond with Maluriath’s dark mirrors. He is the only ogre remotely interested in the dragon’s efforts, although he doesn’t understand the ritual. He protects the mirrors in this area ferociously. When he uses his special power, his eyes and a nearby mirror glow blue. The target appears to be shackled to the floor, but no shackles are apparent in the world.
> 
> ```ad-embed-ability
> title: *Mirror Shackles* **Activate** [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") envision
> **Requirements**: Donjon must be within 30 feet of one of Maluriath’s dark mirrors.
> **Frequency**: This ability recharges at the start of Donjon’s turn only if it failed to affect the target (Success or better on their save).
> **Effect** Donjon targets one creature within 30 feet, mentally shackling them to a fixed point in space via a reflection in the mirror. His eyes and the mirror flash with a ghostly blue glow. The target must make a DC 30 Will save.
> - **Critical Failure:** The target is [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] for 1 round, and [[conditions#Flat-Footed|Flat-Footed]] for the remainder of the encounter or until Donjon dies.  This applies even after escaping the restraint, as illusory shackles linger in the target's mind.
> - **Failure:** The target is [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] until the end of Donjon’s next turn.
> - **Success:** The target is [[conditions#Immobilized|Immobilized]] until the start of its next turn.
> - **Critical Success:** The target is unaffected, and Donjon is [[conditions#Stunned|Stunned 1]].
> ```
> 
> **Euryale:** Accidents and bad luck surround Euryale at every turn, but often these tragedies are visited upon others. At times, he is deeply apologetic for these turns of fate and can verge on pitiable. If he has a chance to shed this bad luck on a foe, he does so in a wave of darkness that sparkles with green glyphs.

## Tactics
The sound of the cave-in signals the other monsters in this area to be ready for intruders.

Foulspawn: The manglers move around the fight to gain flanking whenever they can. They favor attacking characters who damage them.

Ogres: Donjon delays until he can catch a few enemies in the cave-in—see the “Development” section. Then he uses his power. Balance and Euryale prefer to open with their ranged special powers, each ogre targeting a different foe. After these opening attacks, the ogres engage attempt to block the characters’ progress, bottlenecking them in narrow passages if possible.

### Development
At his first opportunity, Donjon causes a cave in. A marked area on the map indicates the area he prefers to target with this attack.

If the characters explore this area, they can learn the following information here. When the heroes proceed into the west corridor, move on to Encounter 3. 

**Dark Mirrors:** The adventurers can learn information similar to that revealed in the first encounter. In addition, they can discover the following additional details.
- [[skills#Perception|Perception]] DC 26: The character discerns a distorted image of Maluriath performing her ritual. Success allows the [[skills#Arcana|Arcana]] check below.
- [[skills#Arcana|Arcana]] DC 26: Maluriath is creating another dark mirror similar to those in this area. This new mirror could create an effect that twists the landscape for miles around the caves.

**Foulspawn Clues:** Any wretch that emerged from a mirror has a twisted similarity to the adventurer who spawned it. Especially if the characters succeeded on the [[skills#Arcana|Arcana]] check above, play up the horrible potential of the mirrors’ effect being unleashed on the countryside.

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** Glowing lichen provides dim light.
**Dark Mirrors:** The warped ground adjacent to the mirrors resembles dragon scales that can move underfoot. This ground is difficult terrain. A non-aberrant creature that starts its turn adjacent to a dark mirror takes 5 psychic damage. Attacks can shatter a mirror (AC 5, Reflex 5, Fortitude 10; hp 20), negating its effects.
**Mangler Spawn:** The first three times any character ends his or her turn adjacent to a dark mirror, that mirror spawns a foulspawn mangler that resembles the character in an unoccupied square adjacent to the character or in the nearest unoccupied square. Each mirror can spawn only one such mangler.
**Support Beams:** An ogre must squeeze whenever its space contains one of these low-hanging structures.
**Rubble:** This debris is difficult terrain.

The corridor west from Encounter 2 leads deeper into the old volcanic passages. After a time, the adventurers emerge in the ogres’ quarters. This large chamber also contains piles of the stone that the ogres mined from the area in Encounter 4.

As the heroes arrive, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The tunnel ahead widens into a torchlit cavern. Heaps of broken stone rise toward the ceiling, and a crude mine cart sits on a track leading off to the south. Hunkered behind a few of the haphazard piles, three ogres snarl in anticipation. A handful of smaller warped humanoids skulk about.
> 
> Although more dark mirrors are here, the fearsome voice of the creature spied in the mirrors emerges not only from their distorted surfaces but also from the southern corridor, rising in pitch and fervor and punctuated by blasts of multihued light. The cavern floor to the north exhibits the same twisting corruption present near some of the mirrors in the room.

As the battle rages, Maluriath’s ritual begins to draw to its close, and ominous tremors are felt in the direction of her lair.

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 3: [[ogre-soldier|Ogre Soldier]] W

> [!Special Powers]
> The ogres in this encounter are named Rogue, Ruin, and Skull. Each one’s personality and special power is described below. Each of these special powers is either a triggered action or requires a standard action to use.
> 
> **Rogue**: Rogue enjoys sowing discord, and he frequently places stolen items in the packs and bed- ding of others. In combat, Rogue tries to see if he can cause a foe to attack another of his enemies by mistake. When that happens, the air around Rogue glimmers briefly with red motes of light. He suc- ceeds often enough to keep him looking forward to the next fight.

> ```ad-embed-ability 
> title: *Redirect the Blow* **Activate** `pf2:r` envision
> **Requirements**: The creature must be adjacent to at least one other creature.
> **Trigger**: A melee or ranged Strike hits the creature.
> **Effect**: The rogue twists away at the last moment, tricking the attacker into striking a nearby foe instead. The attacker must attempt a DC 30 Will save.
> - **Critical Success**: The attacker sees through the trick. The attack hits as normal.
> - **Success**: The attacker momentarily hesitates but still lands the blow. Gain resistance 10 to the triggering attack's damage.
> - **Failure**: The attack targets a creature of your choice adjacent to you instead. Resolve the Strike against that new target using the original attack roll. You may then Step into the new target’s space, and the new target is Pushed 10 feet in a direction of your choice.
> - **Critical Failure**: As failure, and the new target is [[conditions#Flat-Footed|Flat-Footed]] against the redirected attack.
> ```
> 
> **Ruin:** Even though he revels in destruction, Ruin struggles not to smash everything within reach when he attacks, including Maluriath’s mirrors. He has caused unintentional damage before. In combat, a single blow from him can reverberate in his foe’s bones, creating a momentary burst of purple light around his target. That creature’s ability to withstand future attacks diminishes for a time.
> 
> ```ad-embed-ability
> title: *Ruin* **Activate** [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") envision
> **Requirements**: Ruin is wielding a melee weapon or using an unarmed attack.
> **Effect** Once per round Ruin makes a melee Strike with a reach of 10 feet. If the Strike hits, it deals `dice:2d10 + 6` damage and the target becomes vulnerable 5 to all damage until the end of Ruin’s next turn. On a critical hit, the target is also [[conditions#Clumsy|Clumsy 1]]. 
> ```
> 
> **Skull:** Brooding and morbid, Skull is remarkably pale for an ogre and has a single-minded fascination with death. His belongings are littered with skulls, bones, and the carcasses of dead wildlife. As he moves in combat, he leaves smaller, ghostly afterimages behind. These images persist after he dies.
> 
> ```ad-embed-ability
> title: *Death Echo* **Activate** `pf2:r` envision
> **Trigger**: Skull dies.
> **Effect** Four wraith-like figments burst from Skull’s broken form, haunting the area he once stood. These figments linger in four squares of Skull’s choice within his space and adjacent squares. These squares become Haunted Terrain for 3 rounds.
> 
> **Haunted Terrain (Aura, Emotion, Fear, Mental, Necromancy):** A creature that enters or begins its turn in a haunted square must attempt a DC 30 Will save.
> - **Critical Success**: Unaffected.
> - **Success**: The creature is [[conditions#Frightened|Frightened 1]].
> - **Failure**: The creature is [[conditions#Frightened|Frightened 2]] and takes `dice: 2d6` mental damage.
> - **Critical Failure**: The creature is [[conditions#Frightened|Frightened 2]], [[conditions#Flat-Footed|Flat-Footed]] until the end of its turn, and takes `dice: 4d6` mental damage**.
> 
> The haunted terrain fades after 3 rounds or if a _bless_ or _sanctify_ spell is cast in the area.

## Tactics
**Foulspawn:** The mockeries moves to keep melee combatant allies between it and the characters. Manglers focus on keeping the mockery safe. 
**Ogres:** These brutes’ primary aim is to block progress into the dragon’s lair. Ruin and Skull prefer direct melee combat, and Ruin uses his special power at the first opportunity. Rogue moves from rubble pile to rubble pile (see “Features of the Area”), toppling them on enemies with little concern for his allies. If Skull is slain and the wraiths appear, the other ogres take it as an ill omen and might be open to negotiating.

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** Torches provide bright light. 
**Bedding:** These two heaps of debris, cloth, skins, and other filth are normal terrain.
**Cart:** This crude wheeled vehicle can provide cover. A creature can use a move action and a successful [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check to shove the cart down the tracks (DC 21 to move it up to half the pusher’s speed, DC 26 to move it up to the pusher’s speed). The pusher does not have to advance with the cart. Getting into the cart is like entering difficult terrain. A single Medium or Small creature can fit easily into the cart. A Large creature must squeeze to get in, as must a second Small or Medium creature. The cart can hold up to two Small or Medium creatures, or one Large creature.
**Tracks:** These rails lead to Maluriath’s lair. The tracks are normal terrain despite passing over difficult terrain.
**Dark Mirrors:** The warped ground adjacent to the mirrors resembles dragon scales that can move underfoot. This ground is difficult terrain. A non-aberrant creature that starts its turn adjacent to a dark mirror takes 5 psychic damage. Attacks can shatter a mirror (AC 5, Reflex 5, Fortitude 10; hp 20), negating its effects.
**Mangler Spawn:** The first three times any character ends his or her turn adjacent to a dark mirror, that mirror spawns a foulspawn mangler that resembles the character in an unoccupied square adjacent to the character or in the nearest unoccupied square. Each mirror can spawn only one such mangler.
**Special Mirror:** The dark mirror in the northwest wall of this chamber is especially potent, since it’s the closest one to Maluriath’s lair. As shown on the map, the area for several squares around this dark mirror is difficult terrain.
**Rubble Piles:** These piles are difficult terrain tall enough to provide cover. 

If the characters explore this area, they might find treasure here. When the heroes proceed north, move on to Encounter 4. 

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> Hidden in the bedding are items that Rogue stole from Maluriath’s hoard: Spell scroll (4th level) (Umbral Graft), Numbing Tonic (Moderate), and 60 gp.

Maluriath’s ritual is drawing to a close.

When the heroes interrupt Maluriath, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The cavern broadens and deepens. Across the chamber from where you entered, an entire wall of obsidian stands exposed and polished. The stone floor has been twisted into a semblance of scaled skin and protruding bone. The flames in three large braziers flicker in time with the chants of the twisted draconic creature before the enormous dark mirror.
> 
> Flesh on the creature’s fanged maw is pulled back to expose the jawbones. Ribs stick out from the dragon’s belly, producing gaping rents in its torso that spill gouts of flame onto the scorched floor. Where once the creature had wings, it now has two clawlike appendages.
> 
> As it pauses to scan the room with dead, milky eyes, the creature speaks in a hideous gurgle. “Yes, come closer. Share my pain.”
> 
> In the mirror, the dragon’s image continues to perform the ritual, filling the air with chants as the braziers flare with chaotic elemental energy. In response, the mirror glows. The air is painfully charged, foretelling the release of immense magical power.

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 1: [[Maluriath]] W

```encounter
name: Mirror Mirror on the Wall
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 1: [[Maluriath]] 
```

Maluriath, Cursed Red Dragon (M)

[[Mirror Mirror.png|Show to Players]]
![[Mirror Mirror.png]]

## Tactics
Maluriath maneuvers to avoid being pinned down and to maximize her attacks. The dragon concentrates on adventurers who interfere with the ritual. If the party succeeds in halting the ritual, the dragon becomes irrational and enraged. Her madness might manifest as a belief that someone is a thief who has stolen from her. Or she might believe that an adventurer is a servant of the devil who cursed her. In either case, she spouts absurd accusations and redirects her attacks at that character.

### The Ritual
> [!Special Powers]
> While the ritual continues, Maluriath has the following aura.
> 
> ```ad-embed-ability 
> title: *Energy Leak* Aura 15 feet
> **Effect**: Any enemy that starts its turn in the aura takes `dice: 2d6` typed damage. If Maluriath has half or fewer of its Hit Points remaining, the damage increases to `dice: 4d6`.  
> ```

A character who has training in Arcana, Religion, or Nature realizes the aura’s source and that the image in the dark mirror is completing the ritual. Integral to the ritual are the braziers, the mirror, and the dragon. 

Disrupting the ritual does harm to the dragon, since she is intimately tied into the eldritch energy flowing here. The adventurers have 10 rounds to stop the ritual, possibly using one of the following tactics. Using any skill requires a standard action. These tactics are a guide—you can allow any creative solution you think might work.

**[[skills#Arcana|Arcana]] (trained only; DC 36):** The character siphons magical energy from the ritual. Success on the check can extinguish one brazier or deal the mirror `dice: 2d10` damage, and it deals Maluriath `dice: 2d10` psychic damage. A character who fails by 5 or more on this check takes `dice: 2d10` psychic damage.

**[[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] (DC 36):** The character can topple a brazier (see “Features of the Area”). Toppling a brazier also deals Maluriath `dice: 2d10` psychic damage. A character who fails by 5 or more on this check takes `dice: 2d10` damage of the same type Maluriath currently deals due to her roiling chaos trait.

**[[skills#nature|Nature]] or [[skills#religion|Religion]] (Trained only; DC 36):** A character who uses the prima or divine power sources can use them in place of Arcana to manipulate the unnatural energy here.

**[[skills#Thievery|Thievery]] (DC 36):** While adjacent to the dark mirror, the character can exploit weaknesses in the mirror to harm it. Success on this check deals `dice: 2d10` damage to the mirror and `dice: 2d10` psychic damage to Maluriath. A character who fails by 5 or more on this check takes `dice: 2d10` psychic damage.

### Ending the Ritual
If the characters successfully mar the mirror and topple all three braziers, the ritual ends violently, and Maluriath takes `dice: 3d10` psychic damage. She also loses her energy leak aura.

If the characters do not end the ritual, then at the start of Maluriath’s turn during the 11th round, the cursed dragon’s image completes it. If this happens, Maluriath gains her aura permanently, and each character takes `dice: 2d10` psychic damage.

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** Each brazier pro duces bright light in a 15-square radius. It’s clear to the characters that these are the only source of light in the room. Once the last one is toppled, the area plunges into darkness.
**Braziers:** These braziers are 3 feet high, tall enough to provide cover and prevents creature from being forced into them. They burn with the same chaotic energy that leaks from Maluriath. A creature adjacent to a brazier can extinguish it with a successful DC 36 Arcana check or can use the following terrain power to topple it.

```ad-embed-ability 
title: *Brazier Topple*
**Requirement** You must be adjacent to the brazier and suc- ceed on an [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check (DC 36).
**Effect**: The brazier tips over extinquishing it but, unleashing a 15-foot cone of elemental energy before it goes out. All creatures in the area must attempt a DC 28 Reflex save. 

- **Critical Success** – No damage.
- **Success** – Half damage.
- **Failure** – Full damage: `dice: 4d6+5` damage of a type matching Maluriath’s current elemental state (e.g., fire, cold, electricity, acid, or force).
- **Critical Failure** – Full damage and the target is [[conditions#Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] from energy backlash or residual instability.
```

**Dark Mirror Wall:** Damage can mar this enormous mirror enough to disrupt its part in the ritual (AC 18, Reflex 17, Fortitude 17; immune to necrotic, poison, psychic, forced movement, all conditions, ongoing damage; 55 hp to disable the mirror as part of the ritual). If a character misses the mirror wall by 5 or more with an attack roll while the ritual is still active, that character takes `dice: 2d10` psychic damage.  If the encounter is over but the characters have not yet destroyed the Dark Mirror Wall they can tell it still contains powerful magical potential. This potential makes the characters feel uneasy when they look at the mirror.
**Deformed Floor:** The enormous dark mirror actively warps the environment here. Any diagonal movement on this warped floor is treated as if the mover is entering difficult terrain. Maluriath is immune to this effect, which continues until the dark mirror is completely destroyed.
**Ledge:** It is a 10-foot climb from the area that has the tracks to the upper cavern floor. The area at the end of the tracks slopes gently up to the top of the raised area.
**Obsidian Rubble:** The heaps of jagged obsidian rubble are difficult terrain and tall enough to provide cover. A creature that unwillingly enters one of these squares takes 5 damage. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.
**Treasure Hoard:** Maluriath’s hoard is difficult terrain.

# Concluding the Adventure
Only Maluriath has the knowledge to complete the ritual, but the adventurers know the Chaos Scar is a magnet for creatures of ill intent. Destruction of the final dark mirror, before another evil force discovers it, is a real concern. Although brute force can disrupt the mirror’s part in Maluriath’s ritual, the mirror requires at least 200 damage to destroy.

Alternately, if any of the PCs attempts to use one of their relics to destroy the mirror, it will instantly succeed and advance to relic to it's next level.

If the adventurers failed to stop the ritual, the corrupting influence of the mirror spreads from the cave at a pace and with effects appropriate for your campaign. Perhaps Maluriath must concentrate while in front of the dark mirror to spread its influence. If she survives and completes the ritual, she spends time expanding this foul energy to create a vile domain for herself.

If Maluriath needs to remain within her lair,  the adventurers might have enough time to mount  a second offensive. But with each passing day, the twisted nature of the cavern intensifies, changing it into a true nightmare landscape. During this time, Maluriath might also have the opportunity to create more foulspawn or subjugate other lackeys.

You could instead decide that the Chaos Scar itself can power the spreading corruption. If this is true, the powerful eldritch energy might attract all sorts of monsters to the area. Further, if the mirror was not already part of the corruption devil’s plans, the object might come to the fiend’s attention.
