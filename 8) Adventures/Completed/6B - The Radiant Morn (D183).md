# Background
A few months ago, drawn by the whispers of dark power and the opportunity presented by the suffering of those living near the Scar, a devotee of Baalzebul known to his ilk as Theran of the False Truth moved into the Chaos Scar with a small band of cultists. Once situated in an abandoned cave, they set up the fake “Temple of the Radiant Morn” and began spreading a message of salvation from the anguish and terrible burdens of the world. Their message was tailored to appeal to the grief-stricken, the suffering, the outcast, and those with nothing to lose. While a few have found the relief and sympathy promised, they are but another means for the cult to propagate its lies, for in reality the temple is a web of deceit designed to spread the Lord of Lies’ influence and lure a steady stream of victims who will not be missed to their dooms. 

By now, the temple has established itself as a local institution. In an effort to widen its net from the poor and disenfranchised and draw in more powerful victims, devotees have begun spreading whispers of lost treasures and forgotten lore uncovered in the Scar. This, they hope, will attract adventurers, wandering scholars, itinerant merchants, and anyone else whose disappearance won’t raise much suspicion.

# Running the Adventure
**NOTE: The players are coming into this adventure early.  Treasure and xp is calculated for level 4.  Adjust accordingly.**

## Commonly-Heard Rumors 
Anyone who spends time in Restwell Keep will hear that a few months ago, a priest who is a stranger to this region arrived with a small band of followers. They found a cave a few miles from the nearest settlement, cleaned it out, and set up the Temple of the Radiant Morn. They spread a message of salvation and relief from worldly woe which has found wide acceptance. 

After some resistance, the locals have grown accustomed to the presence of the temple and its disciples. Its message is nonthreatening, even comforting. 

## Adventure Hooks

### Limping Johann
A beggar, Limping Johann, approaches the characters to barter something he heard on the street that might be of interest to the adventurers for a stiff drink, a bite to eat, or a few copper coins. If the characters oblige, Johann tells them that “the boys from the temple” have been letting drop that they might know something about ancient treasures lost within the Chaos Scar. If the characters ask him about the temple, Johann refers to them as a bunch of naïve do-gooders, but he can give accurate directions to the Temple of the Radiant Morn in exchange for another small gift. (The rumors of treasure are false. This is a ruse the cultists use to draw victims to the temple. The temple itself does not hold much treasure because up to this time, most of its victims have been poor.) 

### An Unknown Quantity
[[4) Bestiary/party-npc/Chendra]] is unsettled by the rumors she has heard of a “Temple of the Radiant Morn” springing up within the Chaos Scar. She has never before heard of any such religious group and fears that it could be up to no good, despite its message of charity and brotherly love. What’s more, he has heard from beggars in town that some of their friends who went to the temple “ just for a look” have never come back. That could be nothing—but if the characters find themselves traveling near the temple and have a chance to look into it, he would like to know what’s really going on. Optionally, characters might themselves overhear beggars discussing this situation and swapping theories about the disappearances. 

**Quest XP:** 
- [x] Quest (50 XP) for routing or destroying the cult (including Theran) and bringing news of it to Chendera.

### The Missing Merchant
[[Bosco Heldam]] approaches the characters and tries to hire them as muscle for his “big score.” He confides in them that there’s treasure to be had out at the Temple of the Radiant Morn, and he intends to have it. This information came to him through “reliable channels” which he refuses to share. 

Don’t make the offer too attractive; it should be clear that he’s an amateur who has fallen for a hoax and now has the fever of easy gold. A bit of asking around reveals that this trader has disappeared on similar wild-goose chases before only to come home a few days later, hungry and mud-smeared and vowing never to go adventuring again. Alternatively, the characters might overhear him making the same offer to some other group of bravos or toughs, accompanied by much whispering and looking over his shoulder. 

A week or more after the characters turn him down, his friends or wife approach the characters to ask for help because the merchant has never been gone this long before. The characters could also be approached without ever having seen or heard the merchant, after his disappearance.0

**Quest XP:** 
- [x] Ques (50 XP) for bringing the merchant home alive.

## Getting Started
After hearing a few rumors or being approached by NPCs, characters might try to dig up their own information on the Temple of the Radiant Morn by making [[skills#Religion|Religion]] and [[skills#Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] checks. Although the name implies some connection to Lathander, no player character trying a [[skills#Religion|Religion]] check recalls ever hearing of a temple calling itself the Radiant Morn (but be sure to purse your lips and think about this for a moment before announcing the result of the roll). A DC 14 [[skills#Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] check with a [[gather-information|Gather Information]] action, however, finds plenty of locals willing to confirm that the temple’s disciples work to relieve the suffering of the worst off, and a DC 18 check finds one who can give reasonably clear directions to its location. 

When heroes arrive at the temple, read or paraphrase the following: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Ahead of you, the rough mouth of a cave yawns wide to reveal what appears to be the interior of a chapel or temple. Inside, a small crowd of gaunt, unkempt, and generally miserable-looking people kneel on the stone floor or mill about quietly. A pair of white-robed figures moves through them, seemingly offering quiet words of reassurance or sympathetic gestures. Traces of strong, musky incense are carried upon the breeze. 

If the characters stand and watch for more than a few minutes, or when they enter the temple, read or paraphrase the following: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Upon seeing you, one of the robed figures turns and gestures widely, saying “Welcome to the Temple of the Radiant Morn, travelers. Within these walls, solace and understanding are freely given.” You see that the speaker and the other white-robed figure are both male humans.

If the characters ask about the temple or its purpose, the speaker responds: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> “We offer compassion, understanding, and what relief we can from the heavy burdens of this world. The hungry are fed, the weary rested, the grieving counseled, and the ill tended. What is it that you seek?” 

Regardless of how the characters respond, the speaker soon becomes determined to lure them into the next chamber. Read or paraphrase the following: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> “I am afraid my duties are here, tending to those in need. Perhaps you should speak with the head of our order. I am sure he will be glad to help you.” The priest motions for you to follow as he moves toward the doors across the chapel. He sounds a small gong beside the doorway before turning back to you: “Our brothers will meet you within to show you the way.” 

The speaker (Kalin) will not accompany the characters through the doorway. If urged to, he insists that he must stay and attend to the congregation. Kalin sticks to the established story if the adventurers have more questions but always turns the conversation back to meeting the head of the order, Theran. 

Suspicious or wary characters might ask for [[skills#Perception|Perception]] checks with an Insight action while speaking with Kalin. He is a practiced liar; an Insight action or passive [[skills#Perception|Perception]] score of 18 generates the feeling that the priest is not as excited about tending to a crowd of needy beggars as his well-rehearsed speech would indicate. A result of 23 or more reveals that something other than brotherly courtesy may be motivating his insistence on ushering the characters through the doorway. 

If the characters refuse to enter the temple’s inner chamber, confront Kalin for being a liar, or become hostile and aggressive, then the priest excuses himself to whisper briefly with his associate. At that time, the pair turns upon the characters and encounter 3 begins immediately. Otherwise, if the characters advance through the doorway, move ahead to encounter 2.

# Encounter 1 - A Warm Reception
![[Pasted image 20230530103159.png|right]]

**Encounter Difficulty:** 
- [x] Extreme (140 XP)

Creatures:
 - 2: [[orc-warrior|Orc Reaver]] R
 - 2: [[orc-shaman|Orc Shaman]] S
 - 2: [[otyugh]] O

```encounter
name: Entrance
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 2: [[Orc Warrior]] 
- 2: [[Orc Shaman]]
- 2: [[Otyugh]]
```

The characters are ambushed by members of the Temple of the Radiant Morn who were sent to be their escorts. Place only the two storm shamans at first; the reavers are hidden behind curtains and the otyughs are in the offal-filled pit. 

When heroes enter the room, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Two members of the Temple wait for you as promised. As you move into the room, you perceive that the heavy aroma of incense in this chamber masks another, fouler smell. No sooner do you notice that than the white-robed figures throw back their hoods to reveal that they are snarling orcs ready to attack!

If players declared their suspicions before entering this room or are acting in an obviously wary manner, then those with passive Insight of 16 or higher are immediately aware of an unfriendly tenseness within the temple priests and are not surprised. Otherwise, they are surprised. The temple guardians are not surprised. 

Regardless of whether they’re surprised, characters with passive Perception of 16 or higher hear rustling from the alcoves and become aware that something is hidden behind the curtains when initiative is rolled. 

## Tactics
The storm shamans hope to lure rash characters into the pit trap. They begin the fight with their vengeful whirlwinds in an effort to slide characters into the pit, then switch to lightning strikes. 

The reavers use their javelins immediately, also with the goal of pushing characters into the pit or the flaming braziers. 

The otyughs hide within the pit, waiting to attack any hero unfortunate enough to fall in. Once the trap has been sprung, the otyughs also try to grab and pull into the pit any character that moves within reach of their tentacles. Because the pit is 10 feet deep, an otyugh in it can reach only 2 squares outside the pit with its tentacles and can’t bite a target that is outside the pit. An otyugh leaves the pit only if this would be the third round when it has no targets within reach. 

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** The two braziers provide bright light in the chamber. If both braziers are dumped over, the illumination becomes dim. 

**Curtains:** The curtains concealing the orc reavers block line of sight but do not hinder movement. They can be drawn open or closed with a minor action. 

**Pit of Offal:** A covered pit is hidden near the center of the room. Fragile timbers support flagstones which match the rest of the floor. The pit is 10 feet deep, and its bottom is covered with liquid filth to a depth of about 3 feet. The stinking sludge is difficult terrain for creatures without a swim speed. Creatures other than otyughs in the offal take a -2 penalty to attack rolls, AC, and Reflex, and creatures other than otyughs that start their turn in the offal take 5 poison damage. 

**Statues:** The statues provide cover and are difficult terrain. 

**Braziers:** The two large, shallow braziers are filled with flaming, scented oil. A creature that moves (or is forced to move) into a square containing a brazier takes 5 fire damage and the brazier is knocked over. Once a brazier is knocked over, it no longer has any effect. 

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> In the offal pit PCs can see several items.  PCs who brave the pit can find a [[wand-of-the-pampered-pet-tv|Wand of the Pampered Pet]], a [[wand-of-mental-purification-tv|Wand of Mental Purification (1st Level)]] and an [[ice-slick-snare-pfum|Ice Slick Snare]].

## Development
After this fight, the characters can either head back to the temple entrance ([[#Encounter 2 - Fleecing the Flock]]) or they can push deeper into the temple ([[#Encounter 3 - The Living Filth]]; leave encounter 3 for when the characters exit the temple).

# Encounter 2 - Fleecing the Flock
![[Pasted image 20230530103908.png|right]]

**Encounter Difficulty:** 
- [x] Extreme (165 XP)

Creatures:
 - 2: [[acolyte-of-the-radiant-morn|Acolyte of the Radiant Morn]] S
 - 9: [[cultist]] H

```encounter
name: Entrance
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 9: [[Cultist]] 
- 2: [[Acolyte Of The Radiant Morn]]
```

The two false priests have moved from comforting the wretched to preaching the message of the Temple of the Radiant Morn. They are weaving the skillful webs of lies so loved by their dark lord, and their audience listens in glassy-eyed rapture. Describe the rest of the scene and alter the read aloud text depending on how the characters arrived at this point in the adventure. Thanks to their paranoia, the two false priests are always on the lookout and won’t be surprised.

Do not place the rot grub swarms at the beginning of the fight; they emerge from hiding only after the struggle is underway. 

When the characters enter, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Gesturing sharply your way, the speaker skillfully weaves your arrival into his speech without missing a stride: “See how the world assails us? The source of your suffering is revealed. Cruel intruders have come to smash our good works and rob us of what little we have! They believe they can take whatever they want with their weapons and their magic! Defend yourselves, oh brothers! Stand up against their greed!” 

## Tactics
The thugs are enthralled by the rhetoric of the false priests and hurl themselves against the characters recklessly until the false priests are both killed, at which point the thugs flee.  

The false priests are happy to use the thugs as shields. They are keenly aware of the braziers’ effect and attempt to keep their foes within it while remaining clear themselves. They are cowards at heart, so once they are below 50% health or all their minions are dead, they become more interested in getting away than continuing the fight. 

The rot grubs appear at the start of the second turn and immediately swarm forward to make the most of their auras. They fight to the death. 

## Features of the Area 
**Illumination:** The braziers, votive candles, and light streaming in through the mouth of the cave provide bright light throughout the area. 

**Braziers:** The thick, musky incense burning in the two braziers is enchanted by the Acolytes of the Radiant Morn to do more than just cover the temple’s stench: a creature within 2 squares of a brazier takes a -2 penalty to Will defense as the fog saps their mental resistance. A creature that moves through a square containing a brazier takes 5 fire damage and the brazier is knocked over. Once knocked over, the square can be navigated safely. A brazier can also be knocked over intentionally as a standard action. This dumps the oil into any square adjacent to the brazier and deals 5 fire damage to any creature occupying that square. 

**Gong:** The gong has no special effect. 

**Pool:** A low wall of stone surrounds the small pool. It counts as difficult terrain and provides cover. 

**Statues:** The statues provide cover and are difficult terrain. 

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> At the base of one of the statues are various offerings: 37gp, 96sp, a [[staff-of-providence-apg|Staff Of Providence]], a [[private-workshop-lotgb|Private Workshop]] and a [[singing-muse-sot2|Singing Muse]].

## Development
The worshipers are not evil; most of them are no more than beggars and wanderers who came to the temple seeking food and some kindness. They fight back because they believe that the characters are here to loot their temple. If characters gleefully slaughter these innocents, look for ways to make them regret their cruelty later. You’ll have a prime opportunity if survivors flee back to Restwell Keep with news of an “unprovoked massacre” at the temple.

# Encounter 3 - The Living Filth
![[Pasted image 20230530135959.png|right]]

**Encounter Difficulty:** 
- [x] Low (20 XP)

Creatures:
 - 1: [[black-pudding|Black Pudding]] B
 - 3: [[giant-whiptail-centipede|Giant Whiptail Centipede]] H

```encounter
name: Entrance
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 3: [[Giant Whiptail Centipede]] 
- 1: [[Black Pudding]]
```

The vile filth created as both a sign and a byproduct of the cult’s devotion to the slug archduke slowly pooled here, where its corruption and foul magic condensed over time until it imbued the sludge with a terrible semblance of life. Now the cultists use the abomination and the carrion eating aberrations that took up residence to dispose of inconvenient objects or people. 

All of the monsters begin the encounter out of sight, so place them on the battle mat only when the adventurers gain line of sight to them. 

When the characters enter the room, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The air of this cavern is foul from the stagnant river of stinking filth that flows across the chamber. 

**Passive Perception 16:** The character becomes aware that something lurks in the cavern, without knowing what or where. Characters who are alerted this way can then make active Perception checks against DC 23; place one carrion crawler or the black pudding on the map for each successful check, even if they are out of sight. Make appropriate adjustments for characters who enter the room especially cautiously or recklessly.

## Tactics
The black pudding floats unmoving beneath the surface of the sludge, readying an action until a character wades into or jumps over the pool. At that point, it bursts from the muck to engulf the unfortunate adventurer. From then on, it engulfs and sustains the grab against as many adventurers as possible. Black pudding spawn attack characters at random. 

The giant whiptail centipedes are aware of the black pudding’s hunting methods and stay hidden until the pudding attacks. Then they rush forward along the floor, walls, and ceiling. They are quite fond of using tentacle to strand heroes within the poisonous stream or adjacent to the ooze. They fall back on their bite only when every target within reach is slowed or immobilized. 

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** Darkness. The only sources of light are those the characters bring with them. 

**Pools of Offal:** The pools and streams of stinking liquid and foul sludge count as difficult terrain to creatures without a swim speed. Creatures other than the black pudding and its spawn in the offal take a -2 penalty to attack rolls, AC, and Reflex. Additionally, creatures that start their turn in the offal take 5 poison damage. Remember that the giant whiptail centipedes can use the walls and ceiling as readily as the floor. 

**Shackles:** The cultists sometimes keep prisoners chained here so they can witness the terrible fate awaiting them when the ooze and giant whiptail centipedes messily consume (or dissolve) other captives. The chains hang empty at this time.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> Scattered around the cave are the remains of from the creatures previous meals.  Players can find amongst the remains: 83gp, 82sp, a [[tome-of-restorative-cleansing-tv|Tome of Restorative Cleansing (Lesser)]], [[cold-iron-armor|Cold Iron Full Plate Armor (Low-Grade)]] and [[clown-monarch-tv|Clown Monarch]].

# Encounter 4 - The Lord of Flies
![[Pasted image 20230530155114.png|right]]

**Encounter Difficulty:** 
- [x] Severe (70 XP)

Creatures:
 - 2: [[nabasu]] R
 - 4: [[cultist]] S
 - 4: [[otyugh]] O
 - 1: [[otyugh-elite|Theran of the False Truth]] T

```encounter
name: Entrance
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 2: [[Nabasu]]
- 4: [[Cultist]]
- 4: [[Otyugh]]
- 1: [[Otyugh Elite, Theran of the False Truth]]
```

This is the heart of the Temple of the Radiant Morn, where the cultists conduct their foul rituals in the name of Baalzebul the Fallen One, Lord of Flies. It is also the source of the noxious sludge found throughout the dungeon. 

The otyughs begin in hiding; place the beasts only when the characters spot them. 

Theran, the leader of the temple, appears human when the characters meet him. At the moment when he first takes damage, his illusory appearance dissolves to reveal him for what he is: a charnel otyugh gifted with high Intelligence. When that happens, provide a suitable description of tentacles bursting through clothing, the head reshaping into a gaping maw, and the body swelling into a bloated monstrosity, all accompanied by a burst of terrible stench, questionable fluids, and thousands of biting insects which swarm around him. 

When the adventurers enter the room, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The already nauseating stench becomes even worse as you enter this vaulted cavern. A statue of a gigantic, sluglike creature vomits forth a continual stream of the vile filth which fills this place. Runes surrounding its corroded mouth hurt the eye to look upon. 
> 
> You become aware of a low, humming noise; it is the sound of thousands of buzzing flies! 
> 
> Four cultists wearing tattered, befouled robes chant from the bank of the stream of filth. They are led by a surprisingly handsome human dressed in sumptuous and incongruously immaculate clothing. He turns and says, “We receive more offerings for Baalzebul, our patron. Let the Lord of Maladomini embrace them!” 

**[[skills#Perception|Perception]] Insight Action DC 16:** The character spots the beady eyes and twitching tentacles of an otyugh hiding in the sludge. If at least three characters succeed on this roll, place both otyughs. Characters who succeed on a DC 23 check sense that Theran is not what he appears to be. 

**[[skills#Arcana|Arcana]] or [[skills#religion|Religion]] DC 16:** The character recognizes the name of Baalzebul, one of the Lords of the Nine who rule over the Nine Hells. Known as the Lord of Lies, the Lord of Flies, and (not within his hearing) the Slug Archduke, Baalzebul is a disgustingly, sluglike being of filth that rules the seventh hell, Maladomini. 

## Tactics 
Theran uses only charnel frenzy to attack until he is forced to reveal his hidden nature by taking damage (his aura is always in effect). Once his subterfuge is stripped away, he uses all of his attacks to full effect; charnel lash is especially useful for pulling characters into the sludge. 

Theran expects the other Otyugh to die for him, and they probably will, but he has no such intention for himself. When it becomes apparent that the battle is lost, Theran will do his best to escape, either by rushing down the hideous stream or even squeezing himself up the filth-spewing pipe in the statue. Abandoning his followers to certain doom in order to save his oozing hide is a price he’s willing to pay. 

The cultists may be nearly as surprised by Theran’s transformation as the player characters are, but they don’t pause in their attacks. They push characters into the sludge or within range of the otyughs whenever possible. Each bolt of lightning fills the cavern with the odor of singed muck, and each whirlwind swirls tiny droplets of stinking liquid into the already foul air. These things have no particular effect, but be sure to emphasize how nauseating this encounter is. 

The Nabasu are here to feed on souls.  They'll support Theran because he has provided them with a steady diet, but are ultimately here to eat.

The otyughs lurk in the stream of slime with their squishy bodies flattened beneath the surface. When a target comes within range, they burst from hiding and spend the rest of the encounter trying to drag tasty morsels into the sludge.

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** Candles, torches, and glowing runes keep the area in bright light. 

**River of Offal:** The stream of stinking liquid counts as difficult terrain to creatures without a swim speed. Creatures other than otyughs in the stream take a -2 penalty to attack rolls, AC, and Reflex; creatures other than otyughs that start their turn in the stream take 5 poison damage. 

**Slug Statue:** Despite the enchantments that keep corruption pouring endlessly from the statue’s mouth, the statue itself has no effect on the encounter besides the mundane attributes common to all statuary.

**Shackles:** Sacrificial victims are kept chained in this chamber until needed. If the characters are looking for the missing trader, Bosco Heldam, they find him here, beaten and unconscious but alive. Otherwise, all the shackles are empty. 

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> Piled in a corner the players find [[cold-iron-armor|Cold Iron Scale Mail Armor (Low-Grade)]], [[sneaky-key|Sneaky Key]] and [[cytillesh-gmg|Cytillesh]].  There is also a book describing a ritual capable of sealing planar tears.  According to notes found about the inside of the book, Theran was concerned with spontaneous chaos rifts intereferring with the development of his cult and had been searching for a way to close them.  This information can be used to enact a ritual to close the chaos rift found in the [[4A - Glowstone Caverns (D177)]] adventure.  The book suggests that a Twisted Shard, a powerful artifact that contains a fragment of raw Chaos energy is required as part of the ritual

# Development 
By the end of this fight, the characters are thoroughly drenched in reeking filth. If they return to town without cleaning up—a task that can take several hours, and they might never get the stench out of some clothing—they will be met with nothing but disgust no matter how successful their expedition was. 

If the characters have not yet defeated encounter 3, then they will find the exit to the dungeon occupied by the false priests and their enthralled parishioners. None of these are particularly loyal to Theran himself, so his demise (or flight) does not concern them; they fight or flee as described in that encounter, with the intention of either claiming the temple for their own use or at least escaping with their lives.
