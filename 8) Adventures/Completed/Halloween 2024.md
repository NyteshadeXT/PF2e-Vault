[[Portal to Harley's Domain - Corrupted.webp|Show to Players]]

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> As you make your way toward the Chaos Scar a chill settles over the air, a creeping cold that feels out of place. The faint scent of candy and dry leaves fills your senses as the world around you begins to shimmer and shift. Ahead, a flickering light emerges, as though a lantern were swaying in an unseen breeze. Then, without warning, the ground darkens, swirling shadows converging into a thick, spiraling mist that slowly takes shape.
>  
> Before you stands a towering portal, framed by twisted branches draped with wilting black vines and dotted with grinning jack-o’-lanterns. The faces carved into the pumpkins flicker with a dim orange light, each one twisted in a different expression of glee, mischief, and malice, casting twisted shadows across your path. 
>  
> Through the portal’s wavering glow, you catch glimpses of another world—a darkened forest beneath a purple sky, where strange lights dance and shadows twist. The portal itself seems to flicker as if struggling to hold itself open, a pulse of light fading in and out, as if fighting to stay alive. Then, a voice drifts through the swirling mist—thin, strained, and unmistakably familiar. It’s Harley’s voice, but weak, almost pleading, reaching out to you with a single, desperate whisper:
>  
> “Help… me…”

When the players step through the portal, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> As you step through the flickering portal, the cold mist clings to your skin, wrapping around you like tendrils of shadow. The moment you cross the threshold, a sudden snap echoes behind you. Turning back, you see the portal sputter and fade, its edges curling inward, shrinking into a single point of dim orange light before winking out entirely, leaving only darkness and silence where it once stood.
>
> You are trapped. The comforting familiarity of your world vanishes, replaced by a strange, oppressive gloom that presses in on all sides. The forest around you seems alive with twisted shapes lurking just beyond sight, shadows dancing beneath a sky stained purple. Harley’s realm feels wrong, broken somehow, and the faint whisper of her voice barely lingers in the air, as though she is slipping away.

### # Encounter 1 - The Haunting Shadows (Level: 10)

![[Haunting Shadows.webp|600]]
[[Haunting Shadows.webp|Show to Players]]

> [!note]+ Read Aloud  
> As your eyes adjust to the dim, distorted light of this eerie realm, a narrow trail appears before you, winding its way through the twisted forest. But something about it feels deeply wrong. Normally, Harley’s realm carries a sense of mischievous charm—playful illusions, harmless frights, and the lighthearted thrill of Hallows Even night. Here, however, that whimsy has soured.
>  
> The trail is lined with skeletal, blackened trees that seem to bend and twist in discomfort, their branches clawing at the air as if struggling to escape. Wisps of mist cling to the ground, coiling around your feet with each step, and the silence is broken only by a distant, mournful whisper that sounds almost like a lost soul crying out in the dark. An unmistakable sense of unease fills the air, urging you onward even as a part of you wants to turn back.
>  
> Ahead, through the thickening fog, you can make out the silhouette of a graveyard—its crooked headstones and sagging iron fence barely visible in the gloom. The sight of it feels foreign, ominous, as if this twisted graveyard was never meant to be here. And yet, it waits, as though it has something to reveal.

**Encounter Difficulty:**

- [x]  Moderate (80 XP)

**Creatures:**

- 3: [[specter]] (Poltergeist variant with eerie laughter)
- 1: [[Graveknight]] (dressed in Harley’s twisted garb)

```encounter
name: The Haunting Shadows
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 3: [[Specter]] 
- 1: [[Graveknight]]
```

**Description:** The adventurers find themselves in a fog-laden graveyard, bathed in an unnatural twilight. Unseen figures dart around the tombstones, whispering the players’ names in eerie tones. Ahead, a tall ghostly knight, dressed in a corrupted version of Halloween Harley’s iconic attire, stands guard, laughter echoing from the darkness.

> [!note]+ Read Aloud 
> The fog swirls around you, clinging to your boots like skeletal hands. From behind cracked tombstones, shapes emerge—shadows with haunting grins, and a figure dressed in tattered orange and black garb steps forward, bearing a twisted mask that hides any trace of humanity.

## Tactics
The specters use their ghostly movement to phase in and out, attacking from within the fog, while the ghost knight defends its ground fiercely. If any player attempts to speak with or intimidate the knight, it mutters about “The New Spirit of Halloween” who seeks to end Harley’s reign.

## Features of the Area
**Graveyard Ruins"** The graveyard is filled with crumbling headstones and broken mausoleums, providing players with cover. 
**Water:** Pools of dark water in the low points of the graveyard can be traversed but require a DC 25 [[skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check to avoid being [[conditions#Slowed|Slowed 1]] by thick mud.

## Development
If the players defeat or capture the specters, a successful DC 28 [[skills#Religion|Religion]] check reveals a twisted rune on their ghostly forms, marking them as thralls to a sinister spirit. This spirit, "The Hallowshade," is the source of the corruption and has started to infiltrate Harley's realm.

# Encounter 2 - The Pumpkin Patch of Terror (Level: 11)

![[Pumpkin Patch.webp|600]]
[[Pumpkin Patch.webp|Show to Players]]

**Encounter Difficulty:**

- [x]  Moderate (100 XP)

**Creatures:**

- 4: [[drainberry-bush|Pumpkin Fiend]]
- 1: [[Shadowforged Guardian|Scarecrow Overlord]]

```encounter
name: Pumpkin Patch of Terror
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 4: [[Drainberry Bush, Pumpkin Fiend]] 
- 1: [[Shadowforged Guardian, Scarecrow Overlord]]
```

As the players emerge from the fog-laden graveyard, they find themselves standing at the edge of a twisted pumpkin patch, but there’s nothing whimsical about this place. The ground is churned earth, damp and clinging, covered with gnarled vines that snake and coil, almost as if alive.

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The smell of damp earth and rotting gourds grows overpowering as you step further into the corrupted pumpkin patch. Vines cling to your feet with each step, their thorns digging into your boots, making every movement a struggle. All around you, large pumpkins shift, creak, and twist, pulling free from the earth, sprouting long, vine-laden limbs and glowing with a sickly green light. Hollowed eyes and jagged grins leer at you as they lurch forward with a sinister purpose.
> 
> At the far end of the field, standing like a dark sentinel, is a towering scarecrow figure, draped in tattered black cloth and crowned with a burlap sack stitched into a horrific face. Its eyes are empty sockets, but they flicker with an unholy, green flame as it raises one crooked arm to beckon the fiends forward. This is no mere farmyard decoration—it is the overlord of this twisted patch, and it looks upon you with an intelligence and malice that chills you to the bone.

## Features of the Area
- **Twisted Vines and Gnarled Roots**: The entire pumpkin patch is tangled with vines and roots that seem to writhe underfoot, making movement a struggle. This area counts as difficult terrain for all creatures.
- **Pumpkin Lanterns**: Eerie green lights flicker inside some of the stationary pumpkins, casting dim light in a 10-foot radius. Any creature that interacts with one of these pumpkin lanterns risks it exploding in a spray of noxious spores (Fortitude DC 24 or take 3d6 poison damage and be sickened 1).

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> A successful DC 26 [[skills#Perception|Perception]] check reveals that one patch glows differently, hiding a [[healing-potion|Healing Potion (Greater)]].  Hidden within a large hollowed-out pumpkin near the far end of the patch, the players can find a [[cold-iron-weapon|Cold Iron (Standard Grade)]] [[maul]] that seems very out of place. Its purpose is unknown, but the faint arcane aura suggests it may be of use deeper in Harley's realm.

## Development
If the players manage to capture or closely examine a fallen Pumpkin Fiend, they might notice faint traces of strange runes carved into the inside of its shell, glowing faintly with residual magic. A successful DC 21 [[skills#Arcana|Arcana]] check reveals these runes are recent and bear a corrupting signature unlike Harley’s magic, suggesting that the fiends were animated by an intruding power, not her own playful spells.


# Encounter 3 - Harley’s Prison (Level: 12)

**Encounter Difficulty:**

- [x]  Extreme (160 XP)

**Creatures:**

- 1: [[Dreadmarrow]]
- 2: [[dread-wraith|Dread Wraith]]

```encounter
name: Harley’s Prison
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 1: [[Dreadmarrow]]
- 2: [[Dread Wraith, Nightmare Scarecrow]]

```

As the players step out of the shadowed forest and into a clearing, they see Harley’s familiar cottage-keep transformed into a macabre scene of entrapment and corruption. Just outside the front door, a cage of twisted bone pulses with eerie, unnatural energy, radiating a faint, sickly green light. Inside the cage, Harley’s form flickers weakly, her once vibrant aura dimming, as a figure of pure nightmare siphons her magic.

> [!note]+ Read Aloud  
> The air grows cold, and an oppressive silence fills the clearing. Before you stands Harley, trapped in a cage of pale, gnarled bones that twist and throb like living things. Each rib-like bar seeps an eerie, greenish light, dimly illuminating Harley’s form within. Her once vibrant energy is now a faint shimmer, her face pale and drawn as she stares, unable to break free.
> 
> Guarding, to either side of the cage are a pair of wraith-like creatures with simmering red eyes.  In front of the cage looms a nightmarish figure. Towering and gaunt, its form seems part shadow, part flesh. Wrapped in a cloak of darkness, its frame is draped in tattered shrouds that flutter as though alive. Its face, if it could be called one, is a grinning, skull-like visage, with hollow eye sockets that burn with flickering, green flames. Bony hands tipped with long, clawed fingers extend as it siphons Harley’s power, pulsing with a twisted, sickly light.
> 
> The figure shifts, its eyeless gaze settling on you. From its mouth comes a voice like a thousand whispers layered in a low, guttural rasp: “You’re too late!” "Once I finish draining her power, Hallows Eve will be MINE!"

![[Dreadmarrow.webp|600]]
[[Dreadmarrow.webp|Show to Players]]

Dreadmarrow appears like a harbinger of nightmare itself, towering and lanky, with limbs that stretch disturbingly long as it shifts. The flickering green fire in its skull-like face casts a dim glow, illuminating the grotesque twists in its bones and shadowy form. Harley’s cage pulses in rhythm with Dreadmarrow’s siphoning, and her form is visibly dimming, her spirit visibly weakened.

## Features of the Area
- **Harley’s Cage of Bone**: The bone cage surrounding Harley absorbs energy  sending it to Dreadmarrow. Players may attempt to break the cage with a **DC 28 Athletics** check or a **DC 25 Arcana** check to dispel its necromantic energy. The cage can also be attacked (AC 24, Hardness 10, HP 50). Destroying the cage will end Dreadmarrow’s siphoning of Harley’s power, weakening it temporarily.
- **Flickering Shadows**: The shadows around Dreadmarrow seem to have lives of their own, curling and writhing at its command. Once per round, Dreadmarrow can manipulate these shadows to create false images or eerie sounds, imposing a -1 circumstance penalty to Perception checks made in the area.

> [!note]+ Read Aloud  
> As your final blow strikes, Dreadmarrow lets out a guttural, unearthly wail, his twisted form writhing and withering as blackened vines peel from his body like dead petals in the wind. His shadowy essence unravels, fading into the chill air, as his grip over Harley's realm vanishes. The bone cage holding Harley dissolves, releasing her, and she steps forward with a tired but grateful smile.
> 
> The landscape around you begins to shift; the ominous gloom lifts, revealing the vibrant, mischievous colors of Halloween—festive oranges, deep purples, and midnight blues—slowly returning to her domain. The fog recedes, and distant lights twinkle as if a grand celebration waits just beyond the horizon.
> 
> "Well done, my dears!" Harley exclaims, clapping her hands with delight. Her voice, though still soft and delicate, is full of life and strength. "You’ve faced more than your fair share of *tricks* this holiday, wouldn’t you say? I think it’s time for your well-earned *treats!*" With a flourish, she gestures, and suddenly a table appears before you laden with glittering treasures, hallows eve goodies and a few mysterious items wrapped in cobwebbed cloth. "Take what you like!" she says, her voice warm and inviting.
> 
> "I must admit, there's quite a bit of... *cleaning up* to do around here." She waves her hand toward the remnants of dark vines, and they wither to dust as her magic sweeps them away. "You know how it is—can't have any old visitor stumble in and find *this* mess. I have to restore the joy of Halloween, not let it become some dreadful nightmare." As she speaks, a swirling portal opens nearby, radiating a gentle orange glow with glimmers of gold. "When you step through," she says, her voice soft with a touch of genuine affection, "you’ll find yourselves right back from where you came. Like it never even happened. I think you know how this works by now.  Funny thing, time, in my realm." She winks, a little spark of mischief returning to her eyes.
> 
> Harley steps back, giving a playful wave as she bids you farewell. "Until next Hallows Eve, perhaps? I’m always in need of a little help with the... *occasional rogue spirit.*" With a final laugh, she watches as you step through the portal, her realm fading from view as you re-enter the familiar world of your own.
> 
> As you step out, you realize that, indeed, only a few hours have passed—just enough for you to feel a lingering sense of adventure and, in your pockets, the curious treasures Harley has bestowed upon you as tokens of her gratitude.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> Heaped among the holiday treats are 300 gp, 1500 sp, 5000 cp and  [[Grave-Tide]], [[Gravekeeper Bow]], [[Imbued Grave Dirt]] and [[Rot Lord's Ring]]
