![[3B - The Splintered Spring (D179)-20240103130445894.webp|right]]

# Background 
When the great meteor fell, a fragmenting cloud of deadly debris tore countless rifts and sinkholes into the earth at the mouth of the Chaos Scar. As one such fragment cut its way through the surrounding landscape, it tore open an underground spring and carved a deep chasm beneath it. That spring now forms an unusual lake on the surface which conceals a pair of connected caverns below. Aberrant energy fills these caverns as a result of the meteor’s destructive passage. 

A foulspawn cult has been drawn to this area of the Chaos Scar. Their center of power is deeper in the valley, but a group of low-level foulspawn dolgaunts, dolgrims, and dolgarrs has been driven out of that sanctum and into exile. 

The dolgaunt monk leader of this exile band dreams of returning to the cult in triumph. To that end, he has used his aberrant power to take control of a pack of phase spiders he and his cohorts discovered beneath the splintered spring. These phase spiders have begun roaming the countryside around the King’s Wall in search of magic items—valuable relics with which the dolgaunt monk hopes to buy his way back into the cult’s good graces.

# Running the Adventure
**Total Adventure Value:** 335 xp plus gray oozes from the final encounter

**Religious Relic ([[Restwell Jobs#Wall Postings|Job Board]]):** A religious relic, Cup of Chance, has been stolen from a group of pilgrims on their way to the temple of Tymora. Those who witnessed the theft speak of a swarm of ghostly spiders that entered the priest’s camp past armed guards. These spiders targeted and stole the relic with almost humanoid cunning. See [[4) Bestiary/party-npc/Chendra]] for more details. 

**Ritual Book:** The mage, [[Ailwin]], recently purchased an expensive ritual book for research purposes. While being brought to his estate by well-armed couriers, the book was stolen. One wounded courier crawled to Restwell Keep, where he spoke only of being swarmed by “ghost spiders, spawned of the underworld,” before dying. [[Ailwin]] offers a reward of 50 gp to anyone who can find and return the book. 

**Ulrika is Missing:** The farmers working on the outskirts of Restwell Keep are living in fear after a pack of monstrous “ghost spiders” swarmed through the area. A retired adventurer, turned farmer, named Ulrika stood against them and the farmers believe she was killed, and that the spiders hauled off her body in the dead of night. The characters are given a description of a unique amulet worn by Ulrika.

## The Splintered Spring
Whichever adventure hook you use to get the characters into the adventure, the party is taken to the last place the spiders were seen by witnesses. From there, the creatures’ trail can be followed easily, either over the King’s Wall or within the area of the Chaos Scar. 

When the characters pick up the trail, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Even with the time that’s passed, the distinct tracks of the so-called “ghost spiders” are easy to follow on the open ground. Every ten paces or so, huge clusters of spiked footprints slash the ground. You estimate the number of creatures at a dozen or more, but their impossibly long stride defies easy explanation. 

The phase spiders use their teleport speed to move on the run, touching down only every 30 feet. When the characters follow the spiders’ trail to a dry streambed that leads to the splintered spring, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A twisting course cuts its way through wild grass and scrub trees rustling in the wind. This was a streambed once, but no trace of water runs between its overgrown banks now. Its course breaks slowly to the southwest, and the tracks continue along it. 

An hour’s walk brings the characters within sight of the splintered spring. When they arrive, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The breeze from ahead carries the faint scent of water. Spikes of upthrust rock surround the streambed on all sides, providing cover as you advance to within sight of a hissing haze of mist. A powerful underground spring bursts from the surface of the ground, surrounded by shards of splintered stone that stand like a crown around it. The spring which once fed the stream has been forcefully redirected into a small lake. The lake is dotted by islets of rock rising just a few feet above the surface. The tracks of the spiders point straight toward the closest of these islets before disappearing. 

The rocky islets form a maze across the surface of the lake, each 15 to 20 feet across and 20 to 30 feet apart. The phase spiders teleport from rock to rock when they cross the lake. The heroes are free to explore the shores of the lake. They can judge its size as approximately 500 feet in diameter. 

The fractured network of chasms that have filled to become the lake was caused by a fragment of the meteor tearing through this area, as was the upheaval that caused the spring to be rerouted. If the characters circumnavigate the lake completely, they notice that although the spring flows into it at a fast rate, there is no sign of where it flows out again. Moreover, the center of the lake remains shrouded in mist at all times. 

The characters need to cross the lake to pursue the spiders. Swimming is an option, but adventurers who circumnavigate the lake find a crudely built but sturdy raft with six poorly carved paddles on the far shore. The foulspawn use this and a matching raft currently at the center of the lake to cross the water. 

As the characters approach the center of the lake, go to [[02) Serpent Strike]]

# Encounter 1 - Serpent Strike
![[Pasted image 20230726153915.png]]

**Encounter Difficulty:** 
- [x] Moderate (90 XP)

Creatures:
 - 2: [[dolgaunt]] D
 - 3: [[living-waterfall|Living Waterfall]]

```encounter
name: Serpent Strike
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 2: [[Dolgaunt]]
- 3: [[Living Waterfall, Elemental Water Serpent]]
```

The first half of the characters’ passage across the lake is uneventful. When they cross, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The wind scatters waves through the narrow channels between rubble-strewn islets but does nothing to clear the roiling mist at the center of the lake. No sign of the bottom can be seen, though dark schools of fish dart past occasionally. As you approach the mist, a distant hissing can be heard. 

When the characters reach the halfway point represented by the tactical map, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Suddenly a keening wail rises from ahead. The dark shapes of two enormous water serpents race out into the channel beyond a distant islet, a pair of foul and howling humanoids riding them. The skin has been flensed from their glistening bodies. Their sightless eyes and the tentacles writhing from their backs and shoulders seem to seek for you. 

It takes 2 rounds from the time the serpents and their dolgaunt riders appear until they reach the top of the tactical map. The party has time to put in the raft at one of the rocky islets if they do not wish to fight from the raft or on the water. 

The living waterfall is not allied with the foulspawn, but it has learned to fear their power and to feed on their leavings. It lurks unseen beneath the water. It attacks in the fourth round of combat and will flee if reduced to 10 hit points or fewer. 

## Into the Mist 
Once the guardian creatures are disposed of, the characters can continue on into the mist. At that point, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The hissing sound grows louder; the mist wraps around you as you approach. Visibility is cut to nothing and a damp gloom settles across the scene. Suddenly, a wall of black rock looms ahead, curving away to vanish into the mist to the left and right. 

There is no shore here, but the heroes can easily lash the raft to the 15-foot-high rock wall. The wall can be climbed with a DC 17 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check, revealing a remarkable sight beyond. When the heroes reach the top of the rocks, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Even through the mist, you can see that the sheer rock wall encloses the center of the lake in a rough circle. This is no island but a crater approximately 50 feet across. You stand on the rim, which extends only 5 feet before plunging down again. A quarter of the way along the crater’s edge, a deep gash in the rock allows the water of the lake to pour over in a misty torrent, then disappear into a dark rift below. 

This waterfall is the outflow that balances the splintered spring. Characters who spend any time exploring the area can see clear signs where the spiders alighted along the rim of the crater, then climbed down alongside the hissing falls. If the characters circumnavigate the entire crater wall, they find another raft lashed to the rock on the far side. 

The crater wall is rough and easily climbable ([[skills#athletics|Athletics]] DC 19), but the rift is dark beyond 20 feet down. The adventurers see no sign of other creatures as they descend. 

## Features of the Area 
**Illumination:** Bright during daytime; dark at night. 

**Raft:** The characters’ raft is 3 squares on a side and moves at a rate of 1 square per round per character paddling. The raft is sturdy enough that it cannot be attacked. It floats in place if no one is paddling it. 

**Deep Water:** The lake is approximately 30 feet deep. Creatures in deep water must use ([[skills#athletics|Athletics]] skill to move (DC 14; move at half speed). Creatures in deep water gain cover except against attacks from submerged enemies. Fighting in the water imposes a –2 penalty to attack rolls except with spears and crossbows, and powers that have the fire keyword take a –2 penalty to attack rolls. A creature in the water can move onto a rocky islet or onto the raft by spending 1 extra square of movement. 

**Rocky Islet:** The small islets that break the surface of the water are the tops of sheer pinnacles of rock plunging straight down. The islets are spread across the entire surface of the lake, each 15 to 20 feet across and 20 to 30 feet apart. (The phase spiders teleport from rock to rock when they cross the lake.) The rubble-strewn surface of an islet is difficult terrain. A creature that moves off the islet goes into the deep water

# Encounter 2 - The Foul Mire
![[Pasted image 20230727141737.png]]

**Encounter Difficulty:** 
- [x] Moderate (80 XP)

Creatures:
 - 1: [[dolgarr]] B
 - 3: [[dolgrim]] W
 - 2: [[living-waterfall|Living Waterfall]] M

```encounter
name: The Foul Mire
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 1: [[Dolgarr]]
- 3: [[Dolgaunt]]
- 2: [[Living Waterfall]]
```

The characters descend 60 feet into a rough chasm punched into the earth by a fragment of the great meteor. As they climb down, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The chasm walls narrow as they slope slowly inward. Damp mist rises from the the waterfall crashing past. Rough handholds make the climbing easy despite the damp stone. A broad cavern opens up below; the falling water has worn a wide stream through it. Patches of glowing fungi dot the walls and give rise to a pungent scent of decay. 

There is no illumination in the shaft above, and any light carried by the party alerts the creatures here. The dolgarr is anxious to fight, so it continually peers out from its hiding place. It can be spotted with a DC 15 [[skills#Perception|Perception check]]. The dolgrim keep much better hidden. If the characters are not carrying illumination and they pause to let their sight adjust to the dim light, they spot the dolgrim with a DC 20 [[skills#Perception|Perception check]] check. If they carry lights or rush into the gloom, the [[skills#Perception|Perception check]] DC is 25. 

If the characters see the dolgrim, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A grotesque creature lurks in the shadows of the cavern below. Its face is split by two gaping maws that slaver soundlessly, and four arms extend from its squat torso. Its body is slathered in black mud that all but hides it in the shadows. 

When the characters descend to the cavern floor, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Blackened scrub trees clutch at the rocky walls and floor of the cavern, inexplicably growing despite the lack of light. A foul mire of rotting muck spreads in patches across the floor. The wide stream surges through it, then plunges over the edge of a sinkhole at the center of the cavern. 

The heroes start in any squares along the start area marked on the map. Any creatures that the characters did not spot will attack with surprise. The foulspawn have a rough alliance with the mud lasher that inhabited this cavern before they arrived. 

## Tactics 
If the creatures here have surprise, the dolgarr charges the nearest adventurer. Once combat begins in earnest, the dolgarr wades into combat, targeting heavily armored foes with both of its foe-hurler attacks. While that power recharges, it makes club or meaty fist attacks against lightly armored foes. 

The dolgrim warriors snipe with their crossbows from behind cover for as long as possible, making double action attacks and trying to force foes through foul muck to reach them. 

All these creatures fight until destroyed. When either dolgrim is bloodied, it begins shrieking a warning that will be heard by the dolgaunt in the cavern below.

## Development 
When combat is done, the characters have a chance to investigate the cavern. 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> On the far side of the cavern, a wide shelf of stone holds a rough camp. A foul reek hangs over the area. Horrid nests of mud and branches mark the sleeping areas of a dozen creatures. The walls are scribed with horrific symbols in dried blood, and shattered chips of bone are set into the rock like mosaic tiles. A half-dozen humanoid bodies lie nearby, all partially eaten. 

The foulspawn in the adventure represent half of the dolgaunt’s followers. The others are scouring the countryside for food and supplies (it was their raft the heroes borrowed). 

The symbols here have meaning only to the aberrant minds of the foulspawn. Anyone looking at them for more than a few seconds feels noticeably uneasy. A character who insists on making a [[skills#Perception|Perception check]] in an attempt to decipher the symbols takes a –2 penalty to Will during the next encounter. 

The bodies are of unfortunate humanoids slain and eaten by the foulspawn. If you used the Ulrika is Missing adventure hook, the characters can identify Ulrika’s body by the amulet still around her neck. 

The only way down from this cavern is the sinkhole into which the stream plunges.

## Features of the Area 
**Illumination:** Phosphorescent fungus sheds dim light throughout the area. 

**Ceiling:** 20 feet high, opening to a chasm that rises 60 feet to the crater above. 

**Black Trees:** Stunted black trees draw on the aberrant energy of this cavern to grow. A tree provides cover. It takes a DC 10 [[skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] or [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check to move through a square containing a black tree; failure indicates the moving creature stops moving in the last square before entering the tree’s space. A creature that starts its turn adjacent to a black tree is slowed until the end of its turn. 

**Foul Muck:** Heavy black muck steeped in aberrant energy covers the floor of the cavern and is difficult terrain. Any creature not aberrant or elemental that enters an area of muck or starts its turn there is subject to an attack: +8 vs. Fortitude; the target is slowed and takes a -2 penalty to defenses until the end of its next turn. 

**Rough Pillar:** Spires of rock thrust up 10 feet from the cavern floor. A pillar provides cover and is blocking terrain. A pillar can be climbed with a DC 10 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check.

**Ledges:** These ledges stand the indicated height above the cavern floor. Climbing up to a ledge takes a DC 10 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check. 

**Stream:** The water coursing down from above forms a fast-flowing 3-foot-deep stream through the muddy cavern. The stream is difficult terrain. A creature that enters the stream or starts its turn there must make a DC 17 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check or be knocked prone. A creature knocked prone in the stream slides 4 squares toward the sinkhole. A prone creature must stand to move out of the stream. 

**Sinkhole:** The center of the cavern is a rough sinkhole 30 feet in diameter, through which the stream falls. A creature that moves into the sinkhole gets a saving throw to catch the edge. On a failed save, the creature falls 40 feet to the black lake in the cavern below. Because the churning water of the stream cushions the fall, the character takes half damage from the fall. See the next encounter for details of the black lake.

# Encounter 3 - The Black Lake
**Encounter Difficulty:** 
- [x] Severe (145 XP)

Creatures:
 - 4: [[dolgaunt]] D
 - 2: [[ether-spider|Ether Spider]] S
 - 3: [[gray-ooze|Gray Ooze]]

```encounter
name: The Black Lake
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 4: [[Dolgaunt]]
- 2: [[Ether Spider]]
- 3: [[Gray Ooze]]
```

This encounter can play out in different ways, depending on how the characters enter the area. Read through the entire encounter to familiarize yourself with the setup of the gray oozes and the tactics of the creatures in the cavern below. It is very likely that some adventurers will end up fighting alone in the cavern or the black lake while their allies are still trying to descend through the sinkhole. 

## The Sinkhole 
Unlike the descent to the cavern above, the climb down the sinkhole to the black lake is a dangerous one. Moreover, the phase spiders and their dolgaunt master have set up this area as a deadly gauntlet for would-be intruders. 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Where the stream spills down from the foul mire, mist shrouds the darkness below. Unlike the rough stone of the shaft above, the wet walls of the sinkhole offer only minimal handholds. However, great sheets of webbing cling to those walls, glistening with moisture but offering an easy means of descent. 

Anyone who inspects the chasm from above recognizes that the webs are strong enough to hold a climbing character. There is no other sign of immediate danger (if one discounts the giant spider webs)—the gray oozes cannot be seen from the top of the sinkhole. 

Characters must make [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] checks to climb down the 30-foot sinkhole to the mouth of the cavern below, then to climb down the final 20 feet to the cavern floor by way of webs or rope. In addition to the rigors of the climb, dozens of deadly gray oozes cling to the sinkhole walls, where they are concealed by webs. A character who does not spot a slime is subject to its attack as it breaks free of its web shroud. 

Each time a character makes a successful [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] check to move one-half its speed down the sinkhole, have the player make a [[skills#perception|Perception]] check to notice the closest slime. On a successful check, the character can avoid the slime, which then stays dormant. On a failed check, the slime attacks. The Perception and Athletics DCs depend on a hero’s method of climbing.

| Climbing Method        | Athletics DC | Perception DC |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| Rope                   | 10           | 5             |
| No rope, using webs    | 5            | 15            |
| No rope, avoiding webs | 15           | 10              |

Use a battle grid to represent the vertical cavern wall for any gray ooze encounters. Do not let the players know that there is a chance for combat during their descent until a gray ooze actually attacks. The XP figures given for this encounter assume that the characters trigger only one full gray ooze combat. 

Adjust the XP as appropriate, but the characters should receive experience only for gray oozes that are fought and destroyed. Simply escaping from or avoiding a slime nets no XP

## Tactics 
The gray ooze attempts to engulf its victim to prevent it from slipping away. A character not engulfed can make [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] checks to flee by climbing, but the slime’s climb speed gives an adventurer little chance of escaping. The gray oozes fight only along the sinkhole walls. They do not descend into the cavern.

## Falling or Jumping 
A character that falls because of a failed [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] check drops 50 feet minus the distance he or she already descended. The character lands in the fall area indicated on the tactical map. The roiling water cushions the impact so that a fall deals half damage. 

A character that intentionally jumps into the black lake (most likely in an attempt to escape or avoid the gray ooze) also takes half damage from the fall. The character can attempt an [[skills#acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check to reduce the damage normally, or can do the same thing with [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] instead (by clutching at and catching nearby web strands to slow their fall). 

## The Black Lake 
When the characters reach the bottom of the sinkhole with a light source, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A foaming lake fills a huge cavern below the sinkhole. A wide stone ledge spreads along its near side. Heavy sheets of webbing run from one side of the ledge to the other, connected by pillars thrust up from the black water. 

Once below the ceiling (20 feet above the water surface), a character can climb along the webs to drop harmlessly into any square on the tactical map. The spiders and the dolgaunt then advance out of the darkness toward the positions indicated. 

A character who falls down the sinkhole, either by failing an [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] check in this encounter or by being swept down the stream in the previous encounter, ends up in a random square in the tactical map’s fall area. 

When the first character drops or steps onto dry ground in the cavern, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> From the darkness along the edges of the cavern comes sudden movement. Four large spiders swarm along the walls and across the floor, suddenly disappearing, then reappearing as they teleport into attack positions under the direction of a humanoid in black robes. The creature appears similar in form to those you fought on the surface of the lake. 

Neither the dolgaunt nor the spiders can attack a character in the lake, but the spiders advance along the shore and onto the webs in an attempt to keep the character from leaving the water. Remember that there is no illumination in this cavern; characters without a light source may hear the spiders but won’t be able to see them. 

## Tactics 
The dolgaunt trusts its spider servants to take care of the intruders and does not enter combat until a character moves into melee range or one of the spiders is slain. Once in combat, the dolgaunt makes tentacle attacks in an attempt to grab and restrain two adventurers, then attacks a third with its deadly fists. It targets lightly armored characters when it can. 

The ether spiders use their ethereal repulsion to teleport characters into the water if possible. All the creatures here fight until destroyed. 

## Development 
Once combat is done, the characters can investigate the dolgaunt’s lair to discover its secrets. See “Concluding the Adventure" section below.

## Features of the Area 
**Illumination:** Dark. 

**Ceiling:** 20 feet high; the sinkhole rises 30 feet beyond that. 

**Rubble:** These areas of loose scree are difficult terrain. A character who runs, charges, or is forced to move through rubble must make a DC 17 [[skills#acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check or fall prone at the end of that movement. 

**Web Bridges:** Heavy webs crisscross the cavern, creating bridges 5 feet above the black lake. The webs undulate wildly when anything moves across them. A creature without a climb speed moving along a web bridge must make a DC 17 [[skills#acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check or fall into the water. The web bridges sag between their anchor points. With a DC 12 [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] check, a character can climb from the water to a web bridge at a climb point marked (by an “X”) on the tactical map. 

**The Black Lake:** The flow from above fills this slowly draining chasm. The water here is 5 feet below the adjacent shoreline and 50 feet deep. Creatures in deep water must use the [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] skill to move. Creatures in deep water gain cover. Fighting in the water imposes a –2 penalty to attack rolls except with spears and crossbows, and powers that have the fire keyword take a –2 penalty to attack rolls. The spiders and the dolgaunt avoid the water if at all possible. 

A creature in the water can move onto the shore by spending 2 extra squares of movement and making a DC 12 [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] check. 

The fragment of the great meteor that created the sinkhole lies at the bottom of the black lake, and its aberrant energy is what drew the foulspawn to this place. Any non-aberrant creature that enters the water or starts its turn there is subject to an attack: +6 vs. Will; `dice: 2d6` damage and the target is slowed. 

**Fall Area:** This area marks where an adventurer falling down the sinkhole lands in the water. The turbulence of the stream pouring down from above makes this area difficult terrain. 

**Sinkhole Perimeter:** This marks the boundary of the mouth of the sinkhole in the cavern ceiling.

**Chaos Crystals:** Chaos crystals rise 5 feet up above the surface of the water. A slick crystal can be climbed with a DC 22 [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] check. 

## Concluding the Adventure
Once the threat of the foulspawn is ended, the characters can investigate the black lake cavern to discover its secrets. 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> At the farthest corner of the ledge, a foul nest of muck and bones is the dolgaunt lair. The same unearthly sigils seen in the cavern above cover the walls here, scribed in filth and dried blood. From beneath a pile of cracked and well-gnawed bones comes the gleam of gold. 

The symbols here have the same effect on a character that studies them as those in the [[#Encounter 2 - The Foul Mire]] encounter. They have meaning only to the aberrant minds of the foulspawn, but anyone who looks at them for more than a few seconds feels noticeably uneasy. A character who insists on studying them or trying to read the symbols takes a –2 penalty to Will which lasts until the party takes an long rest. 

In addition to treasure, the dolgaunt has cast aside the gear of the creatures whose magic it has stolen, including a fragment of an adventurer’s map. The map shows part of a series of caverns and is annotated with cramped handwriting. This cryptic introduction to a wider foulspawn cult worshiping the power at the heart of the Chaos Scar connects to upcoming adventures.
