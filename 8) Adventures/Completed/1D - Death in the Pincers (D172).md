# Adventure Hooks

1. Hunt the Chaosium Drakes

1. A human hunter named Jarek who ventured too close to the Chaos Scar while hunting in the woods had his prey, and nearly his life, taken by a pack of drakes that were covered with glowing blue scales. Jarek escaped while the drakes killed his horse. Jarek had lost a friend a few weeks before to drakes colored like these, so when the drakes that attacked him wandered back into the Chaos Scar, Jared followed and picked off one with his bow before it could disappear into a tunnel with the rest of its pack.

The drake Jarek slew was already injured. A few minutes after he killed it, the drake’s corpse developed weird blisters on its skin. One broke open and blew into fine silvery powder. Jarek isn’t sure, but he’s heard that folk proficient with magic use a similar substance. When the hunter shows the characters the corpse of the drake, it still has three un-popped blisters. If the characters pop a blister, they find their hands or weapon covered with a small puff of residuum, the raw stuff of magic. Each blister seems to yield about 50 gp worth of the stuff!

1. Quest XP: 150 XP for discovering whether the rest of the glowing drakes also manifest residuum blisters when slain, or 200 XP if the characters give Jarek some form of reward for letting them in on this windfall.

1. Revenge & Rewards

1. One of the party’s friends or acquaintances has been slain near the Chaos Scar by a pack of glowing drakes. The friend slew one of the drakes before dying. Use the effects described in the first hook to describe the oddities of the drake’s skin. When revenge and greed coincide, can characters resist for long?

1. Quest XP: 100 XP for avenging their friend. 100 XP for getting every last jot of residuum.
