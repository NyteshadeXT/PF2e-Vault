# Background
The malign influence and corruption found within the Chaos Scar cannot always be traced to a tangible piece of the meteorite. Though many shards remain scattered throughout the valley or claimed by its covetous denizens, some have dissipated, dissolved, melted away, or been consumed by other forces. These shards are never fully destroyed; the meteor’s destructive essence endures within the power that absorbed it, slowly spreading its corruption and perverting its new incarnation with the meteorite’s evil. 

One such shard, separated at impact, slowly burrowed deep into an expanse of rocky terrain, where it found its way into a vein of magma. Liquidated by the intense heat, the shard—along with its corruption and essence—was absorbed into the molten rock. Over time, it rose to the surface as a river of strange lava which glows with an unnatural, bluish hue. This lava followed the channels created by older magma flows, which led it into the underbelly of a long-abandoned metalworking refinery. 

Brought back to life under the cruel direction of taskmaster Barulg and his duergar clan, the refinery’s metalworking resources were used to forge weapons for duergar raiding parties. However, soon after arriving and activating the furnaces, the duergar discovered that the strangely colored lava contained latent magical properties, and they began to experiment in an attempt to harness its power. 

The lava is nothing if not unpredictable, and after many failed attempts—and casualties—the duergar smiths were able to use the lava to craft a single magical weapon: a monstrous warhammer imbued with a fiery essence. Barulg immediately claimed the hammer as his own, forcing the duergar to work the furnaces night and day in hopes of creating more such armaments. 

These magical experiments drew the eye of Sleed, a clever imp with a strong interest in the lava’s strange properties. Sent by his master to observe the meteor’s influence and effects, Sleed easily took advantage of the duergar’s infernal associations to seal a pact for their souls, promising power to Barulg and his duergar when greater devils come to stake a claim in the valley. Sleed then took over the operation, bringing in other devils to help expand and escalate the experiments to create more powerful magic items. 

As the experiments continued and the lava was exposed to rituals, an unexpected side effect occurred: Pieces of the lava and magma began to come alive as elemental servitors, under the control of the ritual caster—namely, Sleed. Seeing the potential in an army of fiery warriors, Sleed began to catalog his experiments, hoping to find a consistent way to create such elementals—or a way to bring even more powerful elementals into being. 

## Sleed 
Sleed is clever, and the imp excels at surviving. If threatened, he tries to bargain for his life while planning an escape. He’s installed a trap door at the bottom of the refinery—large enough only for a creature of his stature—that leads back to the surface. He has no loyalty to Barulg or his clan and won’t hesitate to leave them behind. 

## Barulg 
A cruel brute, Barulg knows little but blood and violence, and he enjoys inflicting pain and suffering on others. Believing that Sleed’s masters will protect him, he becomes angered if the imp abandons him. Barulg has little to say, preferring to let his warhammer converse with the characters.

# Running the Adventure
**Total Adventure Value:** 395 xp

## Adventure Hooks
There are several ways to get the characters involved in this adventure. 

**Get a Job**
Kendon Longstrider, posts a request and reward of 50 gp on the local job board to have a band of adventurers clear out the Goblin Hole.  See the Restwell Jobs section.

**Raiders**
Goblin raiders were sighted east of the King’s Wall. Traditionally, the goblins have used the Goblin Hole as a base in that area. Someone should investigate the hole and find out how the goblins were able to cross the wall so easily. (They scaled the wall on the backs of their spider minions.) Worryingly, some of the goblins were shouting the name Urgog as a battle-cry. 

**Divinations**
Magical divinations by Chendera, the half-elf cleric who oversees the temple of Tymora at Restwell Keep, point to the existence of some growing threat in the depths of the woods. Unless stopped, this threat may grow too powerful to be dealt with easily, so heroes must put an end to it quickly. She advises the characters to seek out the rumored “Goblin Hole” and begin investigating there. 

**Hapless Adventurer**
Another adventurer encountered a band of goblins crossing through the lands east of the Scar. These goblins were pushing a crudely-made cart laden with swords, helmets, and other booty. The adventurer captured one of the goblins and questioned the wretch, who revealed that the cart was “tribute for Urgog the Mangler, King of the Goblin Hole.

## Getting Started 
### Research
A [[skills#Society|Society]] roll (DC15) or consulting with local greybeards (such as the silver-masked mage [[Ailwin]] at Restwell Keep) lets the characters find out that Urgog was once a feared goblin warlord, but no one has heard of him in more than ten years. 

### Down the Goblin Hole 
After crossing the King’s Wall, the characters travel into the woodlands in the south of the Chaos Scar. The forests here are thick and dark, with few clear trails. In places, the trees are strangely twisted and mutated by the malign influence of the Scar. Initially, the adventurers do not encounter any threatening beasts, but they cannot escape the feeling that they are being watched by inhuman eyes in the dark of the woods. 

### Goblin Ambush 
- [x] Simple (50 XP)
> [!tip]+ Skill Challenge - Ambushing the Ambushers
> As they approach the Goblin Hole, characters see signs of the goblins—footprints, discarded arrowheads, small paths cut through the underbrush, and the stumps of smaller trees cut down for firewood. If the characters blunder on through the woods, then they automatically run into the goblin ambush (Encounter 1). If they proceed carefully, run the optional skill challenge, Ambushing the Ambushers.

**Tactical Encounter 1:** The Goblin Ambush 

# Encounter 1 - The Entrance
![[Pasted image 20230704164200.png]]

**Encounter Difficulty:** 
- [x] Moderate (100 XP)

Creatures:
 - 4: [[goblin-warrior|Goblin Sniper]] G
 - 2: [[vine-lasher|Vine Lasher]] V
 - 1: [[deathjump-spider|Deathjump Spider]] D
 - 2: [[spider-swarm|Spider Swarm]]

```encounter
name: Hangman
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 4: [[Goblin Warrior]] 
- 2: [[Vine Lasher]]
- 1: [[Deathjump Spider]]
- 2: [[Spider Swarm]]
```

The goblin snipers are in the trees, 15 feet above the ground. The deathjump spider also starts in the trees but jumps down to join the fight as soon as battle begins. 

**If the characters failed or did not attempt the “Ambushing the Ambushers” skill check, then read the following aloud before setting up the encounter.** 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> As you make your way through the forest, you spot something glistening between two trees. It’s a strand of spider web, so thin as to be almost invisible if it were not for some droplets of dew. Looking more closely, you realize that there’s a full web stretching between those two trees ... and the trees next to them. You’re hemmed in on all sides by webbing. It’s a trap! 

The characters start in the web-covered area at the bottom of the map. If a character tries to move out of this area, then he must make a DC20 Athletics check or be restrained (save ends). 

**If the characters succeeded in the skill check, read the following section aloud instead.** 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Just in time, you spot a cunningly hidden spider web stretching between two trees. You cautiously make your way around the web and find several other, similar webs between other trees. You came close to falling into someone’s trap... 

In this case, the characters start in the open beyond the web-covered area. 

## Tactics
The goblin snipers stay in the trees and keep firing, targeting characters caught in the spider web if possible. If the characters get too close, they move through the trees to keep out of melee range. 

The vine lashers stay in the middle of the battlefield and use their impaling thorns and pulling vines to drag grabbed characters back toward the bottom of the map, away from the snipers. The vines attack melee characters first. 

The deathjump spider uses its death from above attack to move quickly around the battlefield. Ideally, it knocks down the character nearest to the goblins to give the vine lashers a chance to grab and drag that character. If none of the heroes are close to the goblins, then the deathjump spider tries to set up flanking attacks with the spiderlings and vines. When surrounded, it uses prodigious leap to flee back to the safety of the trees. 

## Development 
A clear trail leads off from the ambush site toward the Goblin Hole. 

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> Searching the webbed copse of trees turns up the corpse of another adventurer who wandered into the trap and starved to death. His body has been sucked dry by the spiders, but his equipment is still intact. Characters can salvage a longsword, leather armor, and 45 gold pieces from the corpse.

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** It’s daylight. 

**Trees:** The goblin snipers have concealment thanks to the foliage of the trees, giving a -2 penalty to attack rolls targeting them. They are 15 feet off the ground, so they can only be hit by ranged attacks or weapons with Reach. Climbing a tree requires a DC 15 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] skill check. The trees are so close together that their branches have interwoven, allowing characters to move between adjacent trees without needing to climb back down. The trees are considered difficult terrain. 

**Webs:** One copse of trees is covered in sticky webs that trap creatures who blunder in, making that copse into a potential killing ground if characters did not succeed at the “Ambushing the Ambushers” skill challenge; see above.

# Encounter 2 - The Metalworks
![[Pasted image 20230507150609.png]]

The corrupted lava flows into this room, where the weapons are created and the bulk of the experiments performed. Several duergar work the furnaces with one of Sleed’s imps, preparing another attempt at creating a lava-infused magical weapon. With the noise from hammers, steam, and the roaring furnaces, it’s difficult for them to hear anyone approaching. They expect the sentries to alert them to any potential problems. 

**Encounter Difficulty:** 
- [x] Low (65 XP)

Creatures:
 - 1: [[duergar-guard|Duergar Guard]] G
 - 1: [[imp]] I
 - 3: [[duergar-miner|Duergar Miner]] M
 - 1: [[magma-hurler|Magma Hurler]] H

```encounter
name: The Metalworks
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 1: [[Duergar Guard]] 
- 1: [[Imp]]
- 1: [[Magma Hurler]]
- 3: [[Duergar Miner]]
```

The magma hurler starts hidden in the river of lava until its allies are in trouble. Do not place it on the map until it attacks. 

## Another Ambush
If the characters prevented the duergar from escaping the previous room, the entire party gains a surprise round, regardless of which entrance they take; none of the workers are expecting company, and with the level of noise, it’s almost impossible for them to hear the characters arrive. The guard is relaxed and inattentive, while the miners and the imp are focused on the furnaces. Enemies should be set up as shown on the map. 

If one of the duergar managed to escape from the previous encounter and warn his allies in the metalworks, the characters could be walking into a second ambush. The escaped duergar—along with the guard, miners, and imp—will hide behind the furnaces and on either side of the main door, expecting the characters to use the main hallway entrance. Readjust their setup positions to reflect the situation. Characters entering from the hidden doorway will likely enter unnoticed in this scenario, gaining a surprise round. 

If a duergar escaped to the metalworks from the previous encounter, read the following as they near the room: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The always-constant sound of hammers on anvils comes to an abrupt stop, leaving an eerie silence that is soon replaced by loud chatter. 

Regardless of their entrance, read the following when the characters enter the metalworks: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> As you descend deeper into the refinery, you are met with a sudden wall of hot air and ash. The hallway opens up into a giant metalworking facility, which is in surprisingly good condition compared to the rest of the refinery. Stretching toward a tall ceiling of stonework and rock, two giant iron furnaces spout fire and shake violently. Many discarded weapons are scattered around the floor, warped and melted beyond recognition. Near the back of the room is a river of lava, but of a bluish hue, glowing and surging with energy. 

If the characters enter the metalworks unnoticed, read the following: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Several small duergar surround the furnaces, adjusting valves and heating a large sword. An imp rests nearby, floating casually while looking bored. A stout guard leans against one of the walls, his helmet pulled down over his eyes—he looks to be asleep. 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Perception DC 10 The furnaces seem dangerously erratic, spouting fire and the blue lava onto the floor nearby. 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Perception DC 15 The lava flow near the back of the room erupts and splashes with volatile waves. What seems to be a head of molten rock rises above the lava for a second, glaring with fiery eyes before falling back into the channel. 

When the magma hurler appears, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Emerging from the river of lava is an elemental of magma and smoldering rock. 

When a furnace spews lava, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The furnaces shake violently, their metal walls and grates screeching as they strain to hold together. A geyser of lava erupts from inside, throwing flaming slag and magma in every direction.

## Tactics
Regardless of how the battle begins, the imp immediately vanishes and attempts to hide until it sees a good opportunity to attack with tail sting or bite, preferring to flank when possible. If caught in a dangerous position, the imp gives priority to using vanish and retreating rather than attacking. The imp will not hesitate to hover over the lava flow to stay out of a melee character’s reach. 

The guard and miners try to corner the characters near the furnaces, hoping to inflict as much fire damage as possible as the furnaces erupt each turn. The miners have no real tactical prowess but do their best to surround and flank characters when able. The guard uses infernal anger immediately and upon each recharge, saving beard quills for a character who has moved beyond reach. 

Appearing in the most advantageous part of the lava flow, the magma hurler enters combat when either the imp or duergar guard is bloodied or when all three duergar miners are killed, whichever comes first. The magma hurler can stay within the lava flow if within range of the characters but is likely to move out to use magma ball against any characters in a clump.

## Development 
After a quick search of the metalworks, the characters find many piles of warped and useless weapons—remnants of failed experiments—though they can also find the treasure noted below. A DC 12 Arcana check reveals that the bluish lava contains strong magical properties and almost appears to have a life of its own. If the characters are looking for a sample of lava for Ruana, they can obtain it here; Balidor’s brothers, however, are nowhere to be found. 

Although the characters might think they have the element of surprise as they continue, a small fire elemental from the lava flow in the metalworks has already seen and reported the intruders to Sleed, who has started gathering his notes and summoning elemental servitors in preparation for a battle and possible escape. 

## Features of the Area 
**Illumination:** The room is well lit by the furnaces and lava, pulsing with red and blue hues. 

**Elevation:** The ceiling is 30 feet high, made of stonework built into the underside of the rocky terrain. 

**Furnaces:** Each furnace is 10 feet tall, and deals 1d6 fire damage to any creature that enters or begins its turn in one of its squares. At the end of each round, the furnace spews flames and lava, dealing 1d4 fire damage to any creature adjacent to it, which also gains vulnerable 5 fire until the end of its next turn. 

**Lava Flow:** The lava flow is a combination of rock, lava, and magma slowly flowing from the west through a slightly recessed stone channel 5 feet below the floor. A creature falling into the lava takes 1d6 fire damage upon falling in and 1d6 fire damage when starting its next turn in the lava. 

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> Scattered among all the worthless items on the floor of the metalworks is 14gp, 42sp and a *Sprite Apple (Pink)*.

# Encounter 3 - Sleed's Sanctum
![[Pasted image 20230616110728.png]]

The characters continue down another set of stairs and hallways, finally reaching the bottom of the refinery and Sleed’s den, where the corrupted lava broke through the ground and the magical potency is at its peak. Here, Sleed works to perfect his process while Barulg stays nearby to protect him. They have been expecting intruders after hearing the commotion above and have summoned three elemental servitors to assist them in battle. 

**Encounter Difficulty:** 
- [x] Severe (120 XP)

Creatures:
 - 2: [[duergar-guard|Duergar Guard]] Station at enterance
 - 1: [[imp|Sleed]] S
 - 1: [[duergar-taskmaster|Barulg]] B
 - 3: [[ember-fox|Ember Fox]] R
 - 2: [[magma-hurler|Magma Hurler]]
 - Lava Pit

```encounter
name: The Metalworks
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 2: [[Duergar Guard]] 
- 1: [[Imp, Sleed]]
- 1: [[Duergar Taskmaster, Barulg]]
- 3: [[Ember Fox]]
- 2: [[Magma Hurler]]
```

When the characters enter Sleed’s sanctum, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The sheer heat of this room tells you that you’ve reached the heart of the refinery. Much of the floor’s stonework has been removed, revealing a small fissure. Inside, the strange bluish lava seeps out of the rocks, pulsing as it flows through the channel below into the metalworks. Near the chasm is a trio of small magma elementals, smoldering as they await an order from their master. 
> 
> The corner of the room hides a small imp, who eyes you suspiciously before nodding to a duergar, who approaches carrying an enormous maul. Waves of the corrupted lava seem to flow beneath the metal surface of the hammer, which glows and pulses with a familiar blue hue. “I assume you’ve come for this,” he mocks, gesturing to his weapon. “Don’t worry, you shall have it.”
> 
> **Perception DC 15** Some of the stones have been removed from the floor near the rear of the chamber and been replaced with a small wooden trap door. 
> **Arcana DC 15** The chasm here emanates the strongest magical aura in the refinery and appears to be the source of the lava flow.

## Tactics
With their shared fire resistance, Sleed, Barulg, and the Ember Fox will not hesitate to use the lava chasm to their advantage, running over it and attempting to keep the characters on the other side of it when possible. 

The ember foxes have been summoned by Sleed as protection, so they engage any character that damages or threatens the imp. They intentionally walk in and out of the lava. If Sleed tries to escape, all remaining ember foxes move between the imp and the party to intercept the characters and buy him some time. 

Barulg begins combat by using Take Them Down which affects all his allies unlike the standard version.  He follows with his maul against whichever character he believes to be the biggest threat. Although not extremely intelligent, Barulg is a capable fighter and excels in combat. He will always look to flank targets with the elementals while keeping excellent position. The room is quite small and Barulg will use Hammer Strike when characters bunch up and provide multiple targets. 
![[Pasted image 20230616114033.png]]

Sleed’s first priority is to stay alive. He uses vanish immediately and whenever engaged. He uses bite or tail sting only when he has a tactical advantage and room to move. Otherwise, he prefers to hover invisibly above the lava pit and make Arcana checks to trigger the lava’s attack when a character gets too close. Sleed isn’t certain that the characters are strong enough to defeat Barulg and his elementals and won’t stick around to find out if things look bad. He flees immediately when Barulg dies or when all three elementals are defeated. Sleed is clever and will not announce his escape; the imp simply turns invisible and makes a run for it when the characters are disabled or distracted. It’s possible the party won’t notice the devil is gone until after the battle. Sleed intends on using the trap door, but if the characters are aware and seem to be guarding it, the imp heads up the stairs and out of the refinery through the metalworks.

## Development
If Sleed escapes, the characters find charred remnants of notes made in Infernal, which could lead to a future adventure in the Chaos Scar. If decrypted, the notes detail a process for creating powerful elemental servitors even more powerful than the creatures already faced.

If Sleed is captured, he attempts to bargain with the characters for his release. He’s unwilling to give up any information about his masters and their plans but will freely talk about the strange lava and Barulg’s clan. Though the devil in charge is never mentioned, it should be clear that for Sleed and his masters, the refinery was merely a test. 

Found on Sleed’s desk is the treasure. If the characters take time to explore the rest of the chamber, they will discover broken mining picks and light armor bearing the Cragbottom name. The brothers themselves are not here, possibly sacrificed, burned to a crisp, or transferred to another location. That’s up to you to decide. The question of their fate could launch another adventure.

Barulg’s hammer is still intact and can be taken by the characters. Although guardsman Rikter wants to see the weapon as proof of the duergar’s demise, he doesn’t want it, and actually prefers that the characters take it far away. 

## Features of the Area 
**Illumination:** The room is well-lit by lava and torches, but the corners are dim with shadows. 

**Ceiling:** The room has a 10-foot-high ceiling of solid rock. 

**Lava Chasm:** The 4 squares at the center of the chasm contain lava. The surface of the lava is 5 feet below the level of the floor. The 1-square-wide perimeter of rock surrounding the lava is rough stone which acts as difficult terrain. A creature falling into the lava takes 1d6 fire damage upon falling in and 1d10 fire damage when starting its turn in the lava. 

Sleed and Barulg already know how to use the Lava Pit by harnessing the chaotic power of the scar.  Players trained in [[skills#Arcana|Arcana]] had have seen a creature being attacked by the lava can also learn how to control it.

![[Pasted image 20230616114949.png]]

**Trap Door:** A trap door, barely big enough for an imp, leads up to the surface. 

**Sleed’s Desk:** This small wooden desk is covered with charred papers.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> On Barulg is using a [[magma-hammer|Magma Hammer]].  He also carries 9 gp.  Found on and within Sleed's desk the players find another 20 gp, 36 sp, a *Poisonous Dagger* and *Tentacle Potion (Lesser).*
