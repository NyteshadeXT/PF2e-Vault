title: The Star-Touched Grove
adventure_status: "Not Started"

# Background
Hongya was once a proud young elf druid, chosen by her circle to guard one of the last untouched groves that clung stubbornly to life on the edge of the Chaos Scar. For generations, the druids had watched over these sacred places, believing them to be primal anchors that kept the land from succumbing entirely to the strange energies that had poured forth when the starstone fell. Hongya’s grove, with its towering oaks and shimmering pools, was considered one of the most vital.

But the Scar is never still. Somewhere deep within its blasted heart, a shard of the fallen star pulsed with a malignant rhythm, and its corruption spread unseen through root and soil. At first, Hongya dismissed the wilting flowers and restless animals as passing signs of imbalance. By the time she recognized the truth, the infection had reached every corner of her forest. Birds dropped from the sky, deer staggered on blackened legs, and the once-majestic trees groaned like dying men.

Desperate and abandoned by the natural powers she had trusted, Hongya cast her plea skyward. Something answered—not the quiet, nurturing spirits of earth and stream, but a whisper from beyond the stars. It promised renewal, and Hongya, in her despair, accepted. Life returned to her grove, but in a grotesque, writhing parody. Blossoms oozed black ichor, vines lashed like serpents, and the creatures that wandered too near emerged warped by alien vitality.

Restwell Keep has long relied on the druids of the Scar to guide hunters and loggers safely through the strange woods, and to keep its most dangerous denizens in check. But rumors now spread through the keep of beasts that return from the forest with too many eyes, too many limbs, and hungers they never knew before. When a farmer’s lost sheep staggered home sprouting tentacles, gnashing at its own flock, the uneasy whispers turned to fear.

The druids no longer answer the keep’s calls. Travelers who dare approach Hongya’s grove vanish, and the air around it shimmers with a faint starlit glow. The people of Restwell Keep suspect the Scar has claimed another soul—and that the corruption festering within may soon spill into their fields and homes.

# Synopsis
Belvo Halfbeard tasks the characters with investigating the spreading pseudolife near Woodbridge and finding out why Hongya has allowed this terror to hppen.

While the characters are traveling through the greater forest, less than an hour from Woodbridge, some of the more aggressive new varieties of animal life attack. Then, as heroes draw close to the grove, the star Khirad, which answered Hongya, attempts to take control of them. When that encounter is over, the characters have a chance to use Hongya’s garden to shake off Khirad’s influence.

Finally, they confront Hongya in the ancient heart of the grove. She has been changed as much as any of her charges. She hates what she is doing and what she has become, but she is powerless to stop.

# Running the Adventure
- Parchments have begun appearing on the walls of taverns, at the gates of Restwell Keep, and nailed to trees along the hunter’s trails. The notices are penned in a firm druidic hand, sealed with a sigil of oak and flame:

> **“By decree of the Circle, Hongya the Fallen is condemned.  
> Once a guardian of the Scar, she has betrayed her vows and now courts powers beyond this world. The grove under her care festers with star-born corruption, birthing horrors that threaten both forest and field.
> 
> Those who would see balance restored are called upon: seek out Hongya’s grove and end her blasphemy. Proof of her fall—or her destruction—will be rewarded.
> 
> See Lolfinor, elder of the Circle, at the stone circle beyond Restwell Keep for further counsel and recompense.”**

The posting has stirred unease among the farmers and hunters of the Keep. Some mutter that the druids are too harsh, that Hongya may be victim rather than villain. Others whisper of livestock sprouting new limbs, of hunters vanishing without a sound, and of a pale green light drifting through the trees at night.
- [[Ailwin]] has heard that a fallen druid called Hongya had once grown some plants with interesting star-touched qualities. He will pay for samples of these plants - more plants for higher pay.

## Encounter 1: Far Fauna
**Encounter Difficulty:**   
- [ ] Severe (85 XP) Level 15
 ![[8C - The Star-Touched Grove (D219)-1757859798592.webp]]
 
Little natural life remains in this area of the Chaos Scar. The sickly oaks are the only reminder of what the forest should look like. Even the undergrowth has been taken over by knee-high clover plants that play tricks with space and perception. The area is also crawling with creatures that Hongya’s grove corrupted. This chaos-touched fauna is immediately hostile to any natural life.

After the characters enter the forest, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A pack of small, yipping creatures is clustered around a branchless tree that leaks liquid light through cracks in its trunk. The sharp, cold illumination reveals that each little head sprouts rabbit-like ears and teeth, but the attached bodies are melded into an undifferentiated fuzzy mass. The creatures seem to sense that they are no longer alone, and the mass moves in with a chittering wail.

```encounter
name: Far Fauna
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 2: Slug Rabbit
- 2: Tongue Wolf, hidden
```

Star-touched rabbits, united into masses, are roaming the grove, busily destroying any natural life they can sink their teeth into. The nearby tongue wolves charge in after they hear the sounds of battle. They arrive at the positions indicated on the map key at the start of the third round of combat.

At the start of the third round, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> With unearthly keening howls, three white-furred, wolf-like creatures rush toward the battle. Dozens of impossibly thin legs raise their bodies up to head height, so the smooth voids where their eyes should be are easy to see. Each of these creatures sports a writhing, spiked tongue so long that more than half its length is dragging along the ground.

### Features of the Area
**Illumination:** Bright light from the trees and far clover, if not the sun.
**Far Clover:** The light that perpetually shines on these oversized clover plants comes from a different sun. A creature that occupies only squares containing far clover and a creature that occupies no squares containing far clover have total concealment from each other.
**Ruined Trees:** These dying trees are  blocking terrain

## Encounter 2: Star Garden
The following occurs when the characters come within 100 feet of the grove, no matter what time of day it is.

As the characters near the grove, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The stars are out. They are so close that their cold light burns. Maddening chimes issue from them just on the edge of hearing.
> 
> Then one of the stars turns its fell gaze upon you. Its utter contempt crushes your own thoughts and shoves them aside. Whispers and light overwhelm your senses. The star’s presence takes root in your very soul.

Khirad, a malevolent star, has changed each of the characters. Roll `dice: 1d6` 1d6 for each character and consult the list below for results. Read the italicized text corresponding to each character’s result aloud.

**Result: 1 - 3 Khirad’s Hunger**
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The star hollowed out a place in your mind, and now only hunger fills it. The ravening hunger makes it difficult to concentrate.

Whenever the character rolls initiative, he or she is [[conditions#Slowed|Slowed 1]] and takes persistant 15 mental damage (save ends both).

**Result: 4 - 5 Khirad’s Voice**
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The star whispers the secrets of the universe and necessary courses of action to you. You feel a desire to comply.

Whenever the character rolls initiative, he or she is [[conditions#Stupefied|Stupefied]] (save ends).

6 Khirad’s Form
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The light of the star fills you. You fade into the light.

Whenever the character rolls initiative, he or she becomes [[conditions#Blinded|Blinded]], and casts bright light for 5 squares (save ends all).

A [[remove-curse|Remove Curse]] spell can cure the affliction Khirad has imposed on a character. The characters can also use the plants in Hongya’s garden to repair this damage. If left uncured, Khirad’s afflictions fade after the characters rest anywhere outside the grove. Khirad again afflicts uncured characters who return to the grove (with the same effects as before) until the place has been cleansed.

### Finding the Garden
The location of Hongya’s garden is such that visitors from Restwell would naturally pass though it on their way up to the grove. Therefore, the characters go through the garden unless they deliberately avoid it.

When the characters approach the garden, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The path continues through a garden in which several odd plants grow. Shiny black beetles, the size of small dogs, tend the unusual flora.

Inform any players whose characters are suffering from Khirad’s afflictions that the sight of these plants causes the presence in their minds to recoil violently.

Have the players roll initiative, but the only dangers in this encounter are the star effects. Characters can attack and kill the beetles (defense 10, 1 hp each), but they neither fight back nor flee.

#### Ingredients
The heroes can find five star-touched ingredients within Hongya’s garden. Characters can eat these items individually or mix them together to produce 
an effect.

**Eyeball Plant:** Bunches of glistening eyeballs dangle like fruit from several small, conical plants with no leaves. The eyeballs gaze about, staring with unnerving intensity at the characters. The horrid fruit of this vine tastes deliciously sweet, like chocolate covered cherries. If the eyeballs are consumed with no other ingredient, they have no effect.

Characters experiencing Khirad’s Hunger feel a strong desire to avoid eating these eyes, despite an overwhelming compulsion to eat almost everything else in the garden. If such a character eats an eyeball along with some lizard grass (see below), the combination cures Khirad’s Hunger.

**Concentrated Starlight:** A bucket contains liquid light far too bright to look at directly. If consumed alone, the liquid burns, requiring the imbiber to  succeed on a DC 34 Fortitude check or become [[conditions#Fatigued|Fatigued]]. Characters who share Khirad’s Form feel an aversion to this light, but they also feel thirsty when thinking about it. Consuming a honey snail (see below) dipped in liquid starlight cures Khirad’s Form and does not require an Fortitude check.

**Lizard Grass:** Several planters contain grass whose blades resemble tiny lizard tails. If eaten alone, the tails taste like blood and allow a character to voluntarily become [[conditions#Fatigued|Fatigued]] to gain temporary hit points equal to three times the characters Fortitude bonus. These temporary hit points last until the character's next rest.

The grass undulates as if a breeze is stirring it if a character experiencing Khirad’s Hunger or Khirad’s Voice stands within 1 foot of the planters in which the grass grows. Lizard grass cures Khirad’s Hunger if eaten with the fruit of the eyeball plant, or Khirad’s Voice if eaten with an idea seed (see below).

**Idea Seed:** A small tree bears pomegranate-like fruit whose arils have no discernible flavor. A character who eats a seed from this plant with no other ingredient must make a DC 34 Arcana check. Success gives the character a random useful insight, which grants a +5 bonus to the next skill check the character makes before 5 minutes pass. If the check fails, the character becomes [[conditions#Fatigued|Fatigued]].

Characters who hear Khirad’s Voice have a hard time thinking about the tree, and they forget its location every time they look away. If such a character eats an idea seed with lizard grass, the combination cures Khirad’s Voice but does not grant insight.

**Honey Snail:** A sweet, syrupy liquid coats the bodies of these plump snails. A character who eats one can feel the snail continue to wriggle for several minutes after swallowing it, but it produces no other effect if eaten alone.

Characters who share Khirad’s Form can hear the snails whispering about the stars. If such a character dips a snail in the liquid starlight, then eats it, the combination cures Khirad’s Form.

### Leaving the Garden
When the characters are ready to move on, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A well-traveled path leads into an area of the grove where the trees are much older and larger. A queasy intuition suggests that the source of the corruption lies down that path.

## Encounter 3:  Heart of Corruption
**Encounter Difficulty:**   
- [ ] Severe (120 XP) Level 15 (If the players haven't removed their curses increase the XP earned by 50.)
![[8C - The Star-Touched Grove (D219)-1757875380767.webp]]

Hongya has just imbued several porcupines with the essence of the stars. They defend her even as she seeks her own death in battle.

When the characters enter the grove, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The night sky above the grove twists unnaturally. The stars, usually scattered, have clustered into a swirling crown, shedding a cascade of dazzling silver-white light down upon a ring of ancient, blackened trees. For a heartbeat, the brilliance blinds you.
> 
> When the glare fades, four monstrous figures writhe in the grove’s heart.
> 
> Three of them resemble wormlike porcupines stretched to grotesque length, their bodies slick with oozing starlight. Where legs should be, they drag themselves forward on rippling folds of flesh. Each bears crystalline quills as long as a man’s arm, every barb sheathed in shifting rings of chaotic energy that crackle and twitch with unnatural rhythm. The air warps and distorts around them as their spines sway.
> 
> The fourth figure towers above the rest—a bear in shape only. Its limbs are gone, replaced by four thrashing tentacles, each studded with jagged, bone-like crystal growths. Twin lines of swollen, luminescent eyes run down its back, each orb filled with writhing motes of captured starlight that glimmer like faceted crystal.
> 
> The abomination rears, its many eyes focusing upon you. From its slavering jaws, a voice both pained and pleading escapes.
> 
> “At last… you have come! In # Mielikki’s name, I beg you—end my torment… end my life!”
> 
> Before you can act, a voice tears through the grove—low and resonant with the grinding timbre of collapsing stone and breaking worlds. The sound carries not just on the wind but within your very bones, impossible to shut out.
> 
> *“She is mine,”** declares the voice, the same shattering presence that has stalked your steps and poisoned your path. The stars above flare in answer, as if the heavens themselves acknowledge his claim.

 ```encounter
name: Heart of Corruption
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 3: Worm Porcupine
- 1: Hongya
```

Hongya fights until she drops to 0 hit points.

### Features of the Area 
**Illumination:** Bright light, from the stars just overhead. 
**Fell Ether:** A creature that starts its turn in a square of fell ether (white patches on the map) takes 10 psychic damage but gains a +1 power bonus to attack rolls and a +5 power bonus to damage rolls until the start of that creature’s next turn. 
**Ancient Trees:** These huge trees are blocking terrain. 

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> Pushed into the roots of one of the great trees the players can find, DC 32 [[skills#Perception|Perception]] check, Druid's Vestments
> 
> - [ ] gp::34
> - [ ] permanent::[[druids-vestments|Druid's Vestments]] [ilvl::10] [gp::1000]
> - [ ] permanent::[[resilient|+2 Resilient Darkwood Scale Mail]] [ilvl::14] [gp::6580]
> - [ ] permanent::[[staff-of-natures-cunning-som|Staff Of Nature's Cunning]] [ilvl::15] [gp::6500]

## Conclusion 
If Hongya drops below 1 hit point, the stars abandon her and retreat back where they belong. The grove reverts to its natural state, and the fell ether dissipates. The worm porcupines revert to normal and sidle off into the forest.
