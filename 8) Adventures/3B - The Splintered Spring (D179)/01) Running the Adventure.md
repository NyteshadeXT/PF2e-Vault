# Religious Relic
A religious relic has been stolen from a group of pilgrims on their way to the temple of Tymora. Those who witnessed the theft speak of a swarm of ghostly spiders that entered the priest’s camp past armed guards. These spiders targeted and stole the relic with almost humanoid cunning. 

# Ritual Book
The mage, Ailwin, recently purchased an expensive ritual book for research purposes. While being brought to his estate by well-armed couriers, the book was stolen. One wounded courier crawled to Restwell Keep, where he spoke only of being swarmed by “ghost spiders, spawned of the underworld,” before dying. Ailwin offers a reward of 50 gp to anyone who can find and return the book. 

# Ulrika is Missing
The farmers working on the outskirts of Restwell Keep are living in fear after a pack of monstrous “ghost spiders” swarmed through the area. A retired adventurer, turned farmer, named Ulrika stood against them and the farmers believe she was killed, and that the spiders hauled off her body in the dead of night. The characters are given a description of a unique amulet worn by Ulrika.

# The Splintered Spring
Whichever adventure hook you use to get the characters into the adventure, the party is taken to the last place the spiders were seen by witnesses. From there, the creatures’ trail can be followed easily, either over the King’s Wall or within the area of the Chaos Scar. 

When the characters pick up the trail, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Even with the time that’s passed, the distinct tracks of the so-called “ghost spiders” are easy to follow on the open ground. Every ten paces or so, huge clusters of spiked footprints slash the ground. You estimate the number of creatures at a dozen or more, but their impossibly long stride defies easy explanation. 

The phase spiders use their teleport speed to move on the run, touching down only every 30 feet. When the characters follow the spiders’ trail to a dry streambed that leads to the splintered spring, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A twisting course cuts its way through wild grass and scrub trees rustling in the wind. This was a streambed once, but no trace of water runs between its overgrown banks now. Its course breaks slowly to the southwest, and the tracks continue along it. 

An hour’s walk brings the characters within sight of the splintered spring. When they arrive, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The breeze from ahead carries the faint scent of water. Spikes of upthrust rock surround the streambed on all sides, providing cover as you advance to within sight of a hissing haze of mist. A powerful underground spring bursts from the surface of the ground, surrounded by shards of splintered stone that stand like a crown around it. The spring which once fed the stream has been forcefully redirected into a small lake. The lake is dotted by islets of rock rising just a few feet above the surface. The tracks of the spiders point straight toward the closest of these islets before disappearing. 

The rocky islets form a maze across the surface of the lake, each 15 to 20 feet across and 20 to 30 feet apart. The phase spiders teleport from rock to rock when they cross the lake. The heroes are free to explore the shores of the lake. They can judge its size as approximately 500 feet in diameter. 

The fractured network of chasms that have filled to become the lake was caused by a fragment of the meteor tearing through this area, as was the upheaval that caused the spring to be rerouted. If the characters circumnavigate the lake completely, they notice that although the spring flows into it at a fast rate, there is no sign of where it flows out again. Moreover, the center of the lake remains shrouded in mist at all times. 

The characters need to cross the lake to pursue the spiders. Swimming is an option, but adventurers who circumnavigate the lake find a crudely built but sturdy raft with six poorly carved paddles on the far shore. The foulspawn use this and a matching raft currently at the center of the lake to cross the water. 

As the characters approach the center of the lake, go to [[02) Serpent Strike]]
