This encounter can play out in different ways, depending on how the characters enter the area. Read through the entire encounter to familiarize yourself with the setup of the gray oozes and the tactics of the creatures in the cavern below. It is very likely that some adventurers will end up fighting alone in the cavern or the black lake while their allies are still trying to descend through the sinkhole. 

### The Sinkhole 
Unlike the descent to the cavern above, the climb down the sinkhole to the black lake is a dangerous one. Moreover, the phase spiders and their dolgaunt master have set up this area as a deadly gauntlet for would-be intruders. 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Where the stream spills down from the foul mire, mist shrouds the darkness below. Unlike the rough stone of the shaft above, the wet walls of the sinkhole offer only minimal handholds. However, great sheets of webbing cling to those walls, glistening with moisture but offering an easy means of descent. 

Anyone who inspects the chasm from above recognizes that the webs are strong enough to hold a climbing character. There is no other sign of immediate danger (if one discounts the giant spider webs)—the gray oozes cannot be seen from the top of the sinkhole. 

Characters must make [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] checks to climb down the 30-foot sinkhole to the mouth of the cavern below, then to climb down the final 20 feet to the cavern floor by way of webs or rope. In addition to the rigors of the climb, dozens of deadly gray oozes cling to the sinkhole walls, where they are concealed by webs. A character who does not spot a slime is subject to its attack as it breaks free of its web shroud. 

Each time a character makes a successful [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] check to move one-half its speed down the sinkhole, have the player make a [[skills#perception|Perception]] check to notice the closest slime. On a successful check, the character can avoid the slime, which then stays dormant. On a failed check, the slime attacks. The Perception and Athletics DCs depend on a hero’s method of climbing.

| Climbing Method        | Athletics DC | Perception DC |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| Rope                   | 10           | 5             |
| No rope, using webs    | 5            | 15            |
| No rope, avoiding webs | 15           | 10              |

Use a battle grid to represent the vertical cavern wall for any gray ooze encounters. Do not let the players know that there is a chance for combat during their descent until a gray ooze actually attacks. The XP figures given for this encounter assume that the characters trigger only one full gray ooze combat. 

Adjust the XP as appropriate, but the characters should receive experience only for gray oozes that are fought and destroyed. Simply escaping from or avoiding a slime nets no XP

### Tactics 
The gray ooze attempts to engulf its victim to prevent it from slipping away. A character not engulfed can make [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] checks to flee by climbing, but the slime’s climb speed gives an adventurer little chance of escaping. The gray oozes fight only along the sinkhole walls. They do not descend into the cavern.

### Falling or Jumping 
A character that falls because of a failed [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] check drops 50 feet minus the distance he or she already descended. The character lands in the fall area indicated on the tactical map. The roiling water cushions the impact so that a fall deals half damage. 

A character that intentionally jumps into the black lake (most likely in an attempt to escape or avoid the gray ooze) also takes half damage from the fall. The character can attempt an [[skills#acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check to reduce the damage normally, or can do the same thing with [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] instead (by clutching at and catching nearby web strands to slow their fall). 

### The Black Lake 
When the characters reach the bottom of the sinkhole with a light source, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A foaming lake fills a huge cavern below the sinkhole. A wide stone ledge spreads along its near side. Heavy sheets of webbing run from one side of the ledge to the other, connected by pillars thrust up from the black water. 

Once below the ceiling (20 feet above the water surface), a character can climb along the webs to drop harmlessly into any square on the tactical map. The spiders and the dolgaunt then advance out of the darkness toward the positions indicated. 

A character who falls down the sinkhole, either by failing an [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] check in this encounter or by being swept down the stream in the previous encounter, ends up in a random square in the tactical map’s fall area. 

When the first character drops or steps onto dry ground in the cavern, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> From the darkness along the edges of the cavern comes sudden movement. Four large spiders swarm along the walls and across the floor, suddenly disappearing, then reappearing as they teleport into attack positions under the direction of a humanoid in black robes. The creature appears similar in form to those you fought on the surface of the lake. 

Neither the dolgaunt nor the spiders can attack a character in the lake, but the spiders advance along the shore and onto the webs in an attempt to keep the character from leaving the water. Remember that there is no illumination in this cavern; characters without a light source may hear the spiders but won’t be able to see them. 

### Tactics 
The dolgaunt trusts its spider servants to take care of the intruders and does not enter combat until a character moves into melee range or one of the spiders is slain. Once in combat, the dolgaunt makes tentacle attacks in an attempt to grab and restrain two adventurers, then attacks a third with its deadly fists. It targets lightly armored characters when it can. 

The ether spiders use their ethereal repulsion to teleport characters into the water if possible. All the creatures here fight until destroyed. 

### Development 
Once combat is done, the characters can investigate the dolgaunt’s lair to discover its secrets. See “Concluding the Adventure" section below.

### Features of the Area 
**Illumination:** Dark. 

**Ceiling:** 20 feet high; the sinkhole rises 30 feet beyond that. 

**Rubble:** These areas of loose scree are difficult terrain. A character who runs, charges, or is forced to move through rubble must make a DC 17 [[skills#acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check or fall prone at the end of that movement. 

**Web Bridges:** Heavy webs crisscross the cavern, creating bridges 5 feet above the black lake. The webs undulate wildly when anything moves across them. A creature without a climb speed moving along a web bridge must make a DC 17 [[skills#acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check or fall into the water. The web bridges sag between their anchor points. With a DC 12 [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] check, a character can climb from the water to a web bridge at a climb point marked (by an “X”) on the tactical map. 

**The Black Lake:** The flow from above fills this slowly draining chasm. The water here is 5 feet below the adjacent shoreline and 50 feet deep. Creatures in deep water must use the [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] skill to move. Creatures in deep water gain cover. Fighting in the water imposes a –2 penalty to attack rolls except with spears and crossbows, and powers that have the fire keyword take a –2 penalty to attack rolls. The spiders and the dolgaunt avoid the water if at all possible. 

A creature in the water can move onto the shore by spending 2 extra squares of movement and making a DC 12 [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] check. 

The fragment of the great meteor that created the sinkhole lies at the bottom of the black lake, and its aberrant energy is what drew the foulspawn to this place. Any non-aberrant creature that enters the water or starts its turn there is subject to an attack: +6 vs. Will; `dice: 2d6` damage and the target is slowed. 

**Fall Area:** This area marks where an adventurer falling down the sinkhole lands in the water. The turbulence of the stream pouring down from above makes this area difficult terrain. 

**Sinkhole Perimeter:** This marks the boundary of the mouth of the sinkhole in the cavern ceiling.

**Stone Pillars:** Pillars of rough stone rise 5 feet up above the surface of the water. A slick pillar can be climbed with a DC 17 [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] check. Returning to the Splintered Spring If the heroes were adequately challenged by this final encounter, let them climb cautiously back up the sinkhole to avoid the gray oozes.

### Concluding the Adventure
Once the threat of the foulspawn is ended, the characters can investigate the black lake cavern to discover its secrets. 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> At the farthest corner of the ledge, a foul nest of muck and bones is the dolgaunt lair. The same unearthly sigils seen in the cavern above cover the walls here, scribed in filth and dried blood. From beneath a pile of cracked and wellgnawed bones comes the gleam of gold. 

The symbols here have the same effect on a character that studies them as those in the [[03) The Foul Mire]] encounter. They have meaning only to the aberrant minds of the foulspawn, but anyone who looks at them for more than a few seconds feels noticeably uneasy. A character who insists on studying them or trying to read the symbols takes a –2 penalty to Will which lasts until the party takes an long rest. 

In addition to treasure, the dolgaunt has cast aside the gear of the creatures whose magic it has stolen, including a fragment of an adventurer’s map. The map shows part of a series of caverns and is annotated with cramped handwriting. This cryptic introduction to a wider foulspawn cult worshiping the power at the heart of the Chaos Scar connects to upcoming adventures.
