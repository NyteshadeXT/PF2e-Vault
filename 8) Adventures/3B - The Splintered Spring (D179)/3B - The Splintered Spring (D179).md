When the great meteor fell, a fragmenting cloud of deadly debris tore countless rifts and sinkholes into the earth at the mouth of the Chaos Scar. As one such fragment cut its way through the surrounding landscape, it tore open an underground spring and carved a deep chasm beneath it. That spring now forms an unusual lake on the surface which conceals a pair of connected caverns below. Aberrant energy fills these caverns as a result of the meteor’s destructive passage. 

A foulspawn cult has been drawn to this area of the Chaos Scar. Their center of power is deeper in the valley, but a group of low-level foulspawn dolgaunts, dolgrims, and dolgarrs has been driven out of that sanctum and into exile. 

The dolgaunt monk leader of this exile band dreams of returning to the cult in triumph. To that end, he has used his aberrant power to take control of a pack of phase spiders he and his cohorts discovered beneath the splintered spring. These phase spiders have begun roaming the countryside around the King’s Wall in search of magic items—valuable relics with which the dolgaunt monk hopes to buy his way back into the cult’s good graces.
