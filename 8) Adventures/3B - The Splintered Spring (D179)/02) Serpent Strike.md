The first half of the characters’ passage across the lake is uneventful. When they cross, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The wind scatters waves through the narrow channels between rubble-strewn islets but does nothing to clear the roiling mist at the center of the lake. No sign of the bottom can be seen, though dark schools of fish dart past occasionally. As you approach the mist, a distant hissing can be heard. 

When the characters reach the halfway point represented by the tactical map, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Suddenly a keening wail rises from ahead. The dark shapes of two enormous water serpents race out into the channel beyond a distant islet, a pair of foul and howling humanoids riding them. The skin has been flensed from their glistening bodies. Their sightless eyes and the tentacles writhing from their backs and shoulders seem to seek for you. 

It takes 2 rounds from the time the serpents and their dolgaunt riders appear until they reach the top of the tactical map. The party has time to put in the raft at one of the rocky islets if they do not wish to fight from the raft or on the water. 

The living waterfall is not allied with the foulspawn, but it has learned to fear their power and to feed on their leavings. It lurks unseen beneath the water. It attacks in the fourth round of combat and will flee if reduced to 10 hit points or fewer. 

### Into the Mist 
Once the guardian creatures are disposed of, the characters can continue on into the mist. At that point, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The hissing sound grows louder; the mist wraps around you as you approach. Visibility is cut to nothing and a damp gloom settles across the scene. Suddenly, a wall of black rock looms ahead, curving away to vanish into the mist to the left and right. 

There is no shore here, but the heroes can easily lash the raft to the 15-foot-high rock wall. The wall can be climbed with a DC 17 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check, revealing a remarkable sight beyond. When the heroes reach the top of the rocks, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Even through the mist, you can see that the sheer rock wall encloses the center of the lake in a rough circle. This is no island but a crater approximately 50 feet across. You stand on the rim, which extends only 5 feet before plunging down again. A quarter of the way along the crater’s edge, a deep gash in the rock allows the water of the lake to pour over in a misty torrent, then disappear into a dark rift below. 

This waterfall is the outflow that balances the splintered spring. Characters who spend any time exploring the area can see clear signs where the spiders alighted along the rim of the crater, then climbed down alongside the hissing falls. If the characters circumnavigate the entire crater wall, they find another raft lashed to the rock on the far side. 

The crater wall is rough and easily climbable ([[skills#athletics|Athletics]] DC 19), but the rift is dark beyond 20 feet down. The adventurers see no sign of other creatures as they descend. 

### Features of the Area 
**Illumination:** Bright during daytime; dark at night. 

**Raft:** The characters’ raft is 3 squares on a side and moves at a rate of 1 square per round per character paddling. The raft is sturdy enough that it cannot be attacked. It floats in place if no one is paddling it. 

**Deep Water:** The lake is approximately 30 feet deep. Creatures in deep water must use ([[skills#athletics|Athletics]] skill to move (DC 14; move at half speed). Creatures in deep water gain cover except against attacks from submerged enemies. Fighting in the water imposes a –2 penalty to attack rolls except with spears and crossbows, and powers that have the fire keyword take a –2 penalty to attack rolls. A creature in the water can move onto a rocky islet or onto the raft by spending 1 extra square of movement. 

**Rocky Islet:** The small islets that break the surface of the water are the tops of sheer pinnacles of rock plunging straight down. The islets are spread across the entire surface of the lake, each 15 to 20 feet across and 20 to 30 feet apart. (The phase spiders teleport from rock to rock when they cross the lake.) The rubble-strewn surface of an islet is difficult terrain. A creature that moves off the islet goes into the deep water
