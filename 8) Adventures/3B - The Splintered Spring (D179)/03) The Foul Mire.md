The characters descend 60 feet into a rough chasm punched into the earth by a fragment of the great meteor. As they climb down, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The chasm walls narrow as they slope slowly inward. Damp mist rises from the the waterfall crashing past. Rough handholds make the climbing easy despite the damp stone. A broad cavern opens up below; the falling water has worn a wide stream through it. Patches of glowing fungi dot the walls and give rise to a pungent scent of decay. 

There is no illumination in the shaft above, and any light carried by the party alerts the creatures here. The dolgarr is anxious to fight, so it continually peers out from its hiding place. It can be spotted with a DC 15 [[skills#Perception|Perception check]]. The dolgrim keep much better hidden. If the characters are not carrying illumination and they pause to let their sight adjust to the dim light, they spot the dolgrim with a DC 20 [[skills#Perception|Perception check]] check. If they carry lights or rush into the gloom, the [[skills#Perception|Perception check]] DC is 25. 

If the characters see the dolgrim, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A grotesque creature lurks in the shadows of the cavern below. Its face is split by two gaping maws that slaver soundlessly, and four arms extend from its squat torso. Its body is slathered in black mud that all but hides it in the shadows. 

When the characters descend to the cavern floor, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Blackened scrub trees clutch at the rocky walls and floor of the cavern, inexplicably growing despite the lack of light. A foul mire of rotting muck spreads in patches across the floor. The wide stream surges through it, then plunges over the edge of a sinkhole at the center of the cavern. 

The heroes start in any squares along the start area marked on the map. Any creatures that the characters did not spot will attack with surprise. The foulspawn have a rough alliance with the mud lasher that inhabited this cavern before they arrived. 

### Tactics 
If the creatures here have surprise, the dolgarr charges the nearest adventurer. Once combat begins in earnest, the dolgarr wades into combat, targeting heavily armored foes with both of its foe-hurler attacks. While that power recharges, it makes club or meaty fist attacks against lightly armored foes. 

The dolgrim warriors snipe with their crossbows from behind cover for as long as possible, making double action attacks and trying to force foes through foul muck to reach them. 

All these creatures fight until destroyed. When either dolgrim is bloodied, it begins shrieking a warning that will be heard by the dolgaunt in the cavern below.

### Development 
When combat is done, the characters have a chance to investigate the cavern. 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> On the far side of the cavern, a wide shelf of stone holds a rough camp. A foul reek hangs over the area. Horrid nests of mud and branches mark the sleeping areas of a dozen creatures. The walls are scribed with horrific symbols in dried blood, and shattered chips of bone are set into the rock like mosaic tiles. A half-dozen humanoid bodies lie nearby, all partially eaten. 

The foulspawn in the adventure represent half of the dolgaunt’s followers. The others are scouring the countryside for food and supplies (it was their raft the heroes borrowed). 

The symbols here have meaning only to the aberrant minds of the foulspawn. Anyone looking at them for more than a few seconds feels noticeably uneasy. A character who insists on making a [[skills#Perception|Perception check]] in an attempt to decipher the symbols takes a –2 penalty to Will during the next encounter. 

The bodies are of unfortunate humanoids slain and eaten by the foulspawn. If you used the Ulrika is Missing adventure hook, the characters can identify Ulrika’s body by the amulet still around her neck. 

The only way down from this cavern is the sinkhole into which the stream plunges.

### Features of the Area 
**Illumination:** Phosphorescent fungus sheds dim light throughout the area. 

**Ceiling:** 20 feet high, opening to a chasm that rises 60 feet to the crater above. 

**Black Trees:** Stunted black trees draw on the aberrant energy of this cavern to grow. A tree provides cover. It takes a DC 10 [[skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] or [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check to move through a square containing a black tree; failure indicates the moving creature stops moving in the last square before entering the tree’s space. A creature that starts its turn adjacent to a black tree is slowed until the end of its turn. 

**Foul Muck:** Heavy black muck steeped in aberrant energy covers the floor of the cavern and is difficult terrain. Any creature not aberrant or elemental that enters an area of muck or starts its turn there is subject to an attack: +8 vs. Fortitude; the target is slowed and takes a -2 penalty to defenses until the end of its next turn. 

**Rough Pillar:** Spires of rock thrust up 10 feet from the cavern floor. A pillar provides cover and is blocking terrain. A pillar can be climbed with a DC 10 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check.

**Ledges:** These ledges stand the indicated height above the cavern floor. Climbing up to a ledge takes a DC 10 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check. 

**Stream:** The water coursing down from above forms a fast-flowing 3-foot-deep stream through the muddy cavern. The stream is difficult terrain. A creature that enters the stream or starts its turn there must make a DC 17 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check or be knocked prone. A creature knocked prone in the stream slides 4 squares toward the sinkhole. A prone creature must stand to move out of the stream. 

**Sinkhole:** The center of the cavern is a rough sinkhole 30 feet in diameter, through which the stream falls. A creature that moves into the sinkhole gets a saving throw to catch the edge. On a failed save, the creature falls 40 feet to the black lake in the cavern below. Because the churning water of the stream cushions the fall, the character takes half damage from the fall. See the next encounter for details of the black lake.
