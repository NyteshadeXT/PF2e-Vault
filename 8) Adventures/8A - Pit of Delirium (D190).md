![[8A - Pit of Delirium (D190)-1751055390606.webp|right]]

# Background
Yalax the neogi had a run-in with some illithids in the Underdark and was driven to the surface on pain of death. Staggering from defeat and lusting for revenge, the crafty neogi sought a means to gain the advantage against his subterranean enemies and return to his demesne. Yalax found his way to the shattered caves beneath the Chaos Scar and, after months of brooding and exploring, unearthed a fragment of the meteor that crashed into the Nentir Vale and birthed the Chaos Scar. Yalax learned that he could manipulate the fragment’s psychic power and use it to bend weaker minds to his will—or break them entirely. 

The meteor fragment, known as a chaos shard, screams with psychic energy, so much so that even the neogi’s mental powers were put to the test in manipulating it. Wasting no time, Yalax used the shard to dominate other creatures he encountered in the caves beneath the Chaos Scar, including troglodytes, meenlocks, and an umber hulk. Pleased with his newfound slaves, Yalax turned his thoughts toward acquiring more chaos shards; however, the neogi knows of several recent incursions into the Chaos Scar by meddlesome soldiers and adventurers from Restwell Keep, and he doesn’t want them interfering with his own planned excavations. 

The inhabitants of Restwell Keep pose a threat to Yalax. By neogi reasoning, they must be subjugated or destroyed. Commanding his umber hulk slave to burrow a miles-long tunnel to the keep (an ambitious endeavor), Yalax broke into some old catacombs and turned them into a temporary lair. Using the chaos shard, Yalax has begun bombarding the keep above with waves of psychic energy, while dispatching meenlock servants to lure the keep’s addled inhabitants into his clutches. Those who are captured are transformed by the meenlocks into monstrous slaves. 

In addition to orchestrating the disappearances, the neogi has also used the chaos shard to drive the keep’s lord, Lord Drysdale, half-mad with delusions. Drysdale is convinced that the Six Blades of Fortune— the former rulers of Restwell Keep—have returned, despite the fact that they’re all dead (slain by Drysdale). The paladin sees his old enemies lurking about and, in his madness, fears that the Blades intend to reclaim the keep. Drysdale has declared martial law. His soldiers, most of them suffering delusions of their own, have sealed the gates, jailed people whom they suspect are in cahoots with the Six Blades, and ransacked homes, searching for their elusive quarry. As the heroes contend with their own visions and jittery emotions, they must choose to either stand by while Restwell Keep spirals into madness or decide that it is up to them to save it

# Adventure Synopsis
A strange madness is sweeping through Restwell Keep. As fear and paranoia grow, the characters find they are not immune. Moreover, several of the keep’s inhabitants have disappeared without a trace. To discover what is causing the widespread madness and the disappearances, the adventurers must interact with the keep’s remaining inhabitants and search for clues. At the same time, they must contend with Lord Drysdale and his soldiers, who are obsessed with a nonexistent threat brought on by their own madness.

Clues eventually lead the adventurers to a forgotten cellar below the bailiff’s tower of Restwell Keep, which in turn leads to some old catacombs wherein the adventurers face several enslaved troglodytes guarding the way to Yalax’s lair, while simultaneously fending off a psychic assault from the chaos shard.

As the adventurers descend into Yalax’s lair, they are mobbed by meenlocks and former Restwell Keep citizens transformed into meenlock minions. Once they reach the floor of the Pit of Delirium, the heroes are within striking distance of the shard but must finally defeat Yalax and his umber hulk.

# Running the Adventure
When you’re ready to begin the adventure, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Restwell Keep stands on the edge of turmoil. No one is allowed in or out while the garrison searches for evidence of a plot to overthrow Lord Drysdale. The soldiers seem unusually troubled, and you hear whispers among the common citizens that Drysdale has lost his mind and is haunted by the ghosts of dead enemies, believing that the Six Blades of Fortune—the former rulers of Restwell Keep— have returned from the dead to overthrow him.
> 
> Lord Drysdale isn’t the only one plagued by delusions. Fear and paranoia have spread like a fire through the keep; you can see it etched on the faces of guards and commoners alike, and tensions are mounting. In the two days you’ve been holed up in the keep, you’ve experienced your own strange visions and sudden mood swings. It’s as though a contagion has swept through the keep.
> 
> As if the madness isn’t enough, six guards and six commoners have gone missing in the past week. Still, Drysdale’s soldiers seem more interested in the threat posed by the Six Blades of Fortune. If something isn’t done, fear and paranoia will shake Restwell Keep to its foundations.

No one is allowed in or out of Restwell Keep while Drysdale’s soldiers search for the nonexistent Six Blades of Fortune. If the adventurers try to leave, there’s little the guards can do to detain them (at this point in their careers, the characters are much too powerful). Your goal should be to provide incen- tives for them to stay. Hopefully you can leverage the relationships the characters have developed with the citizens of Restwell Keep; however, you might need to throw in the promise of a reward to hook the players. 

For example, self-centered characters might be enticed to stay by the possibility of seizing power from Lord Drysdale or the opportunity of looting the keep amid the chaos.

> [!aside|right] 
> Preparing for the Adventure
> 
> The adventure begins with the characters killing time in Restwell Keep. They begin experiencing strange visions planted in their minds by the neogi’s chaos shard.
> 
> After the party spends at least 24 hours in the keep, each character becomes afflicted by a madness that fades only when he or she is no longer within 1 mile of the chaos shard. These afflictions present role- playing challenges for the players, as well as make the threat of the chaos shard personal. To determine the nature of each character’s affliction, roll a d4 and consult the list below, or assign a random affliction to each character.
> 1.  The character sees people, things, or both that no one else can see. Such delusions might elicit feelings of shame, terror, guilt, or some other strong negative emotion.
> 2. The character suffers moments of emotional instability, becoming suddenly angry, upset, or morose for no good reason.
> 3. The character is convinced that certain others are conspiring against him or her.
> 4. The character is haunted by fleeting shadows and ghost sounds that reflect a secret fear or guilt.

The characters must not only deal with Drysdale’s lockdown of the keep but grapple with their own mental afflictions, as described in the “Preparing for the Adventure” sidebar. Investigating the cause of the madness is handled as a skill challenge. As they root out the cause, the characters also pick up several quests (see “Quests” below). 

The visions and madness caused by the chaos shard are already widespread by the time the characters begin suffering the effects. Visions are usually subtle and menacing, and most citizens affected by the chaos shard are too afraid to speak of their affliction openly out of fear of persecution or because of the guilt, shame, or confusion brought on by their affliction.

By portraying the keep’s residents as paranoid or manic, you can create interesting roleplaying opportunities for yourself and the players.

> [!tip]+ Skill Challenge
> # Uncover the Truth
> 
> The adventurers must wade through the paranoia and confusion in Restwell Keep to find clues leading to the neogi’s lair. In this challenge, the characters try to make sense of the bizarre occurrences and unexplained disappearances.
> 
> Feel free to incorporate roleplaying opportunities and red herrings as part of this skill challenge; for example, the characters might be approached by a paranoid commoner who claims to know the true threat to the keep. She leads them to a stone well within which she hears demonic voices; however, the characters quickly confirm the voices aren’t real.
> 
> Each skill check represents at least 1 hour of investigation. If the heroes are successful, they discover the cellar in the bailiff’s tower and the umber hulk’s tunnel.
> 
> Each time the party succeeds on a skill check as part of this challenge, give them one quest (see “Quests” below) until all three quests are given out.
> 
> **Level:** 14 (60 xp)
> **Complexity:** 1 (requires 3 successes before 4 failures)
> **Primary Skills:**  Arcana, Diplomacy, Intimidation, Perception, Thievery
> 
> ### Special Rules
> Each time a skill check is called for, a character must use a particular skill against a specific DC, as indicated below. The players decide which character makes each check, and the other characters can provide aid if they want to. If a check succeeds, the party obtains a clue or a valuable piece of information, as indicated below. After making six skill checks, the heroes will have either succeeded on or failed at the skill challenge; if they succeed, they will have earned the final piece of information pointing to the bailiff’s tower.
> 1st Check: DC xx Arcana
> 2nd Check: DC XX Thievery
> 3rd Check: DC xx Diplomacy
> 4th Check: DC xx Intimidate
> 5th Check: DC xx Perception
> 6th Check: Any of the above (Players Choice)
> 
> ### Primary Skills
> **[[skills#Arcana|Arcana]] (DC 35, 1 success):** The first successful check reveals powerful mind-affecting magic engulfing the keep. A second successful check allows the character to ascertain that the magic is strongest in and around the bailiff’s tower.
> 
> **[[skills#Thievery|Thievery]] (DC 33, 1 success):** The first successful check reveals that all six missing commoners were behaving erratically or seemed deeply troubled before they disappeared. A second successful check reveals that all the missing folk disappeared at night, and one of the commoners was last seen in the vicinity of the bailiff’s tower.
> 
> **[[skills#Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] (DC 33, 1 success):** With careful words, the character convinces a guard to divulge information. The first successful check reveals that three of the missing guards were on night patrol when they “just wandered off.” A second successful check reveals that the other three missing guards were posted at the bailiff’s tower on the nights they disappeared.
> 
> **[[skills#Intimidation|Intimidation]] (DC 33, 1 success):** The character presses a guard to divulge information. A guard admits to seeing an evil creature skulking around at night. It looked like a short, bug-eyed humanoid with pincers for hands (a meenlock); the guard dismisses it as “a fever-induced delusion.” A second successful check reveals that some of the missing guards were posted at the bailiff’s tower on the nights they disappeared.
> 
> **[[skills#Perception|Perception]] (DC 35, 1 success):** The first successful check reveals that all of the keep’s inhabitants are affected by the madness; however, some are better at hiding their symptoms. A second successful check reveals that citizens living near the bailiff’s tower exhibit the worst symptoms.
> 
> **Players Choice of the Above (DC 33, 1 success):** Description 
> 
> ### Success
> All information leads the characters to the cellar of the bailiff’s tower, where they find the umber hulk’s tunnel.
> 
> ### Failure 
> The characters are unable to track the source of the madness to the bailiff’s tower before they arouse the hostility of the keep’s guards. Drysdale’s guards try to arrest the characters, but they’re significantly lower in level and aren’t a genuine threat. If the characters allow themselves to be detained for questioning, they are interrogated until they divulge the whereabouts of the Six Blades of Fortune or until they convince the more levelheaded guards to release them (which is best handled as a roleplaying encounter). The sergeant of the guard, [[Garrick Blackoak]], might be instrumental  in securing their release. Once they’ve freed themselves from captivity, the characters can attempt the skill challenge again.

## Quests
As they wrestle with their own madness and the rampant paranoia in Restwell Keep, the characters receive the following quests. The quests are given out in the course of completing the skill challenge described above. Each time the party succeeds on a skill check as part of the challenge, give them one quest until all three quests are given out.

### End the Chaos (Major Quest)
As [[Lord Drysdale]]’s delirium becomes the subject of fear and mockery throughout the keep, the adventurers are approached by [[6) NPCs/Restwell Keep/Chendra|Chendra]], the keep’s priestess of Tymora. [[6) NPCs/Restwell Keep/Chendra|Chendra]] is deeply concerned about [[Lord Drysdale]]’s actions. Afraid that he will never surrender control of Restwell Keep, she begs the heroes to intervene on behalf of the keep’s citizens, not just to root out the cause of Drysdale’s delirium but also to stop Lord Drysdale before he becomes a mad despot. If they succeed, the characters will earn the appreciation of the common folk within the keep—and perhaps the enmity of their scornful lord.

**Major Quest Reward:** 20 XP per character for destroying the chaos shard and restoring the peace.

### Break the Wizard’s Trance (Major Quest)
[[Ailwin]], master of the Saruun wizards’ guild, is suffering more than anyone else in the keep. Thanks to the chaos shard, [[Ailwin]] has become trapped in an arcane labyrinth of his mind’s creation. His apprentices have tried for days to free the wizard from his trance but have been unsuccessful. [[Valtaris]], one of the apprentices, suspects that a chaos shard is responsible for all the trouble in the keep and suspects the shard is somewhere close by. Furthermore, he fears that destroying the shard might also shatter his master’s mind. [[Valtaris]] asks the adventurers to recover the shard and allow him and [[Ailwin]]’s other apprentices to use their arcane knowledge to manipulate the shard’s energy in order to safely release the entranced wizard. Although [[Valtaris]]’s intentions are truly noble, the heroes might suspect that he has ulterior motives, further confusing the situation.

**Major Quest Reward:** 20 XP per character for delivering the chaos shard to [[Valtaris]] or for breaking [[Ailwin]]’s trance without killing him. If he survives, [[Ailwin]] rewards the party with a [[brilliant-rapier-lotgb|Brilliant Rapier]].

### Find the Missing guards (Minor Quest)
[[Garrick Blackoak]], Drysdale’s sergeant of the guard, carries out his lord’s commands to hunt down the imagined Six Blades of Fortune but is more concerned with finding his missing soldiers.

**Minor Quest Reward:** 10 XP per character for determining that the missing soldiers were transformed into meenlock spawn and telling this to Blackoak.

## The Bailiff's Tower
This square tower, perched at the keep’s southeast corner, contains quarters for the bailiff and his scribe. However, neither individual is currently residing in the tower. 

**The Bailiff:** [[Kendon Longstrider]] has been arrested on suspicion of colluding with the Six Blades of Fortune. Kendon has long expressed misgivings about Lord Drysdale’s rule; consequently, Drysdale was quick to have him thrown in the dungeons.

**The Scribe:** [[Syradon]] was taken prisoner along with the bailiff. Although it’s widely believed that the young man is deaf and dumb, Lord Drysdale thinks there’s more to [[Syradon]] than meets the eye. Consequently, the scribe is now a “guest” in Drysdale’s fortress.

### Entering the Tower
The tower’s thick oak door is locked. A character can pick the lock with a DC 31 [[skills#Thievery|Thievery]] check, but doing so without being seen by nearby guards also requires a DC 33 [[skills#Stealth|Stealth]] check (or DC 30 at night). Fallek, the corporal of the guard assigned to the main gate, has a key that a character can steal with a DC 33 [[skills#Thievery|Thievery]] check.

The heroes can also beg a key from [[Garrick Blackoak]], the sergeant of the guard (see “Quests” above).

In addition, Yalax’s troglodyte thralls found a key to the tower after the bailiff was arrested and taken away. They keep their key hidden under a straw mat just inside the door.

The tower’s ground floor is a general living space and office. Stone stairs climb to the second floor and descend to the cellar. The second floor once served as quarters for the bailiff and the scribe and contains their cots as well as some treasure. A creaky wooden ladder leads from the second floor to the rooftop battlements.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> Characters looting the tower for treasure find a locked strongbox ([[skills#Thievery|Thievery]] DC 30 to open) containing 50 gp destined for the keep’s treasury. They also find a tiny holy symbol of Waukeen on a silver chain; this belongs to [[Syradon]] and is worth 10 gp.
> 
> - [ ] gp::60

### Exploring the Cellar
Characters searching the cellar of the bailiff’s tower quickly find the umber hulk’s tunnel hidden behind some empty crates and barrels. The tunnel is an  8-foot-wide hole in the floor haphazardly covered with wooden boards. (The meenlocks placed the boards to conceal the tunnel mouth, albeit poorly.)

The tunnel burrows through the earth and clay, spiraling downward at a 45-degree angle for 100 feet before breaking into some old catacombs. A DC 17 [[skills#Nature|Nature]] check reveals that a large burrowing creature dug the tunnel; a character whose check result is 22 or higher recognizes the work of an umber hulk.

If the characters descend the tunnel, proceed with [[#Encounter 1 Old Catacombs]]

### Encounter 1: Old Catacombs
**Encounter Difficulty:**   
- [ ] severe (120 XP) Level 14

![[image]]

The adventurers reach this area by following the umber hulk’s tunnel from the cellar of the bailiff’s tower in Restwell Keep. As it nears this room, the tunnel dips 15 feet below floor level. It then climbs sharply and erupts from the floor in the southwest corner.

When the heroes peer into the room, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The tunnel breaks through the floor of a vaulted chamber supported by thick stone columns and marked with piles of ancient rubble. A revolting stench fills the room, and pale reptilian creatures lurk in the shadows—xulugath.

There are no light sources in the room. The xulgath rely on their darkvision to see.

#### Chaos Shard Delirium
During the battle, Yalax’s chaos shard plants delusions in the minds of the adventurers to make them think slain xulgath are suddenly returning to life. Characters can fight off the delirium induced by the chaos shard, treating it as a hazard.

> [!warning]
> Consider using tokens or other markers to indicate which ones are delirium-induced xulgath risen from the dead.

> [!danger]+ Trap
> ![[chaos-shard-delirium|Chaos Shard Delirum]]


```encounter
name: Old Catacombs
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 1: [[Xulgath Leader Elite]] 
- 2: [[Xulgath Skulker Elite]]
- 4: [[Xulgath Warrior Elite]]
```

[[xulgath-warrior-10]]

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** None. The room is illuminated only with light the adventurers bring with them.
**Collapsed Hallway:** Rubble chokes a corridor in the northeast corner of the room. This passage collapsed many years ago and might lead to other sections of the old catacombs. Excavating the hall is a major operation requiring several days and is beyond the scope of this adventure. However, if you want to expand the old catacombs, this corridor provides the means.
**Gaping Fissure:** This naturally formed pit plunges 20 feet. Any creature falling into the fissure takes `dice: 4d10`  falling damage. Buried in the loose rubble at the bottom of the fissure is the treasure found in this room.  Anyone searching the bottom of the fissure automatically finds it.
**Rubble:** The piled remains of a shattered column as well as rubble cast aside from the umber hulk count as difficult terrain and provide partial cover to creatures kneeling behind them.
**Staircase:** These crumbly stone steps lead to a lower chamber. If the characters descend the stairs, continue with encounter 2: Fate Worse than Death.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
>  A gold dwarf statuette inlaid with mithral filigree worth 100 pp can be found at the bottom of the fissure.
> 
> - [ ] pp::100

### Encounter 2: Fate Worse then Death
**Encounter Difficulty:**   
- [ ] severe (120 XP) Level 14

These lower catacombs are connected to the catacombs above by a stone staircase. Here the adventurers learn the fate of the guards and commoners abducted from Restwell Keep: The poor sods wallow alongside the meenlocks that have corrupted them.

When the heroes reach the bottom of the staircase, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Mounds of rubble litter the floor of this dusty chamber. Lurid purple light rises from the depths of a gaping pit surrounded by a crumbling stone staircase. The light barely illuminates a dozen or more foul shapes standing about the room. Three of them appear small and deformed. They leer at you with milky eyes, snap their pincers, and bare crooked teeth. The rest look like humans in the midst of becoming something else, their bodies crooked and stooped. They flex their claws and shamble forward with the intent to kill.

The citizens of Restwell Keep (six commoners and six guards) have been transformed into [[meenlock spawn]]. A DC 28 [[skills#Occultism|Occultism]] check reveals that these people can be freed from the corruption only if the meenlock dominating them is destroyed. (Each [[meenlock stalker]] controls six spawn.) Even then, the spawn must also be slain and its body burned. The victim can then be restored to its true living form using [[remove-disease|Remove Disease]], [[remove-curse|Remove Curse]] and [[raise-dead|Raise Dead]] or [[resurrect|Resurrect]].

#### Chaos Shard Delirium
During the battle, Yalax’s chaos shard plants more delusions in the minds of the adventurers, making it seem as though the meenlocks (stalkers and spawn) can turn invisible. Characters can fight off the delirium induced by the chaos shard, treating it as a hazard.

> [!warning]
> Consider using tokens or other markers to indicate which ones are delirium-induced xulgath risen from the dead.

> [!danger]+ Trap
> ![[chaos-shard-delirium-ii|Chaos Shard Delirum II]]


```encounter
name: Fate Worse then Death
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 2: [[Meenlock Stalker]] 
- 8: [[Meenlock Spawn]]
```

## Tactics
The meenlock spawn obey the psychic commands of the stalkers and spread out to attack the characters with their claws.

The meenlock stalkers keep their distance, attacking the characters at range with horrid link, maddening whispers, and twisting whispers. A cornered stalker uses dimension step to extricate itself and move to a safer location within range.

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** Dim light (shed by the chaos shard at the bottom of the pit). As one descends the pit, the light grows brighter.
**Rubble:** Treat these mounds of rubble as difficult terrain. The meenlock stalkers have buried a magic item under the smallest pile of rubble. Anyone searching the pile finds the item automatically.
**Pit:** The pit drops 40 feet to the floor of another chamber (see Encounter 3: Pit of Delirium). The stairs that hug the edge of the pit descend to the floor of this lower chamber.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> The meenlock stalkers have buried a [[ring-of-the-ram|Ring of the Ram (Greater)]] under the smallest pile of rubble.
> 
> - [ ] permanent::[[ring-of-the-ram|Ring of the Ram (Greater)]][ilvl::13] [gp::2700]

### Encounter 3: Pit of Delirium
**Encounter Difficulty:**   
- [ ] severe (90 XP) Level 14

The adventurers reach this area either by falling down into the pit or descending the stairs that encircle it.

When the adventurers reach the bottom of the pit, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The pit opens into a spacious chamber bathed in the lurid purple glow of a craggy stone fragment. Bizarre in texture and glistening with crystalline shards, it floats a few feet off the ground. You feel a psychic wind trying to draw you toward it, tearing through your mind with grim intent, and you see your doom reflected in its crystal shards.
> 
> Suddenly, immense shadows move across the walls of the room as two monstrous shapes appear from behind the floating shard. One is a hulking black biped with four eyes mounted above a pair of sharp mandibles. The other is a spidery abomination with the head and neck of an eel. It glares at you with savage hate.

Characters recognize the floating stone as a chaos shard—a fragment of the meteor that formed the Chaos Scar.

#### The Chaos Shard
The chaos shard is a 1,000-pound spindle of jagged rock 5 feet thick and 7 feet tall. Despite its weight, it floats and can be pushed easily. If pushed over a ledge, it sinks slowly until it’s levitating only a few feet above the ground.

If the chaos shard is destroyed, Yalax shrieks in fury as the delirium plaguing Restwell Keep ends abruptly. Unless the characters have their own light sources, the room goes dark.

```encounter
name: Pit of Delirium
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 1: [[Umber Hulk]] 
- 1: [[Neogi, Yalax]]
```

> [!danger]+ Trap (Chaos Shard)
> ![[chaos-shard|Chaos Shard]]

## Tactics
The chaos shard begins the battle under Yalax’s control and assails enemies with winds of madness. Characters can take control of the shard and use it to attack Yalax and the umber hulk. If this happens, Yalax attempts to regain control.

Yalax uses enslave and mind twist to turn his enemies against one another. The neogi can tell which enemies are infected with meenlock corruption and targets them foremost. If Yalax is bloodied and the umber hulk is slain, the cowardly neogi uses psychic shackles to restrain enemies before fleeing through the exit tunnel (see “Features of the Area”). In melee combat, Yalax uses scything claw to slide enemies into the chaos shard’s aura or within range of the shard’s winds of madness attack.

The umber hulk uses confusing gaze to keep the party as near to it as possible and rending claws against grabbed prey.

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** Bright light (the chaos shard). 
**Exit Tunnel:** Leading away from the chamber is a rough-hewn tunnel flanked by two mounds of  rubble (difficult terrain). The miles-long tunnel, which was created by the umber hulk, leads back toward the Chaos Scar, eventually breaking the surface amid a copse of trees. The tunnel serves as Yalax’s escape route.
**Pit:** A rough-hewn, 10-foot-deep pit in the northeast corner serves as Yalax’s nest. Characters searching the nest find a level 13 uncommon or rare magic item and two gemstones worth 1,000 gp each.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> Characters can find a suit of [[glorious-plate-locg|Glorious Plate]], a [[malleable-mixture-lotgb|Malleable Mixture]] and 234 gp.
> 
> - [ ] gp::234
> - [ ] permanent::[[glorious-plate-locg|Glorious Plate]] [ilvl::14] [gp::4500]
> - [ ] consumable::[[malleable-mixture-lotgb|Malleable Mixture]] [ilvl::000] [gp::000]

# Concluding the Adventure
If the heroes defeat Yalax and bring the chaos shard to the surface, [[Ailwin]]’s apprentices can study it and find a way to destroy the shard without harming the wizard (see “Quests” above). If the heroes destroy the shard, [[Ailwin]] falls into a coma. Freeing him from his coma requires a [[Remove Curse]]. 

Destroying the shard ends the madness in Restwell Keep. Kendon the bailiff and Syradon the scribe are released from custody. The keep’s citizens and defenders are deeply troubled by recent events, and faith in Lord Drysdale’s leadership is sorely shaken. If the characters invest money and time to revive the citizens who were transformed into meenlocks, they become popular figures in Restwell Keep and might find themselves at the center of an uprising, 
allowing them to usurp Drysdale’s mantle of leadership and assume control of the keep. (If his authority is contested, Drysdale backs down without a fight and returns to Fallcrest in disgrace.) Were they to take charge of the keep, the heroes could wage open war against the monstrous inhabitants of the Chaos Scar. If Yalax escaped, the heroes might encounter the neogi again, hiding in a cave complex deep within the Chaos Scar and plotting his revenge.
