# Background
Yalax the neogi had a run-in with some illithids in the Underdark and was driven to the surface on pain of death. Staggering from defeat and lusting for revenge, the crafty neogi sought a means to gain the advantage against his subterranean enemies and return to his demesne. Yalax found his way to the shattered caves beneath the Chaos Scar and, after months of brooding and exploring, unearthed a fragment of the meteor that crashed into the Nentir Vale and birthed the Chaos Scar. Yalax learned that he could manipulate the fragment’s psychic power and use it to bend weaker minds to his will—or break them entirely. 

The meteor fragment, known as a chaos shard, screams with psychic energy, so much so that even the neogi’s mental powers were put to the test in manipulating it. Wasting no time, Yalax used the shard to dominate other creatures he encountered in the caves beneath the Chaos Scar, including troglodytes, meenlocks, and an umber hulk. Pleased with his newfound slaves, Yalax turned his thoughts toward acquiring more chaos shards; however, the neogi knows of several recent incursions into the Chaos Scar by meddlesome soldiers and adventurers from Restwell Keep, and he doesn’t want them interfering with his own planned excavations. 

The inhabitants of Restwell Keep pose a threat to Yalax. By neogi reasoning, they must be subjugated or destroyed. Commanding his umber hulk slave to burrow a miles-long tunnel to the keep (an ambitious endeavor), Yalax broke into some old catacombs and turned them into a temporary lair. Using the chaos shard, Yalax has begun bombarding the keep above with waves of psychic energy, while dispatching meenlock servants to lure the keep’s addled inhabitants into his clutches. Those who are captured are transformed by the meenlocks into monstrous slaves. 

In addition to orchestrating the disappearances, the neogi has also used the chaos shard to drive the keep’s lord, Lord Drysdale, half-mad with delusions. Drysdale is convinced that the Six Blades of Fortune— the former rulers of Restwell Keep—have returned, despite the fact that they’re all dead (slain by Drysdale). The paladin sees his old enemies lurking about and, in his madness, fears that the Blades intend to reclaim the keep. Drysdale has declared martial law. His soldiers, most of them suffering delusions of their own, have sealed the gates, jailed people whom they suspect are in cahoots with the Six Blades, and ransacked homes, searching for their elusive quarry. As the heroes contend with their own visions and jittery emotions, they must choose to either stand by while Restwell Keep spirals into madness or decide that it is up to them to save it
