A few days ago, a wereboar slaver named Magrak Ironjaw attacked the remote village of Cled to capture prisoners he intended to sell as slaves. Magrak, his own troops, plus those of the Proud Boys bandits, led the prisoners across the King’s Wall and into the scar, bound for the Slaver’s Stone not far from the valley mouth. There, he hopes to offload the chattel to an orc chieftain who is known to be a good customer for slavers. 

Hot on the wereboar’s heels, however, is Cluff Maclire, chief and warleader at Cled. He nearly caught the slaver, but lost Magrak’s trail at the King’s Wall. Cluff then traveled to Restwell Keep, where he hopes to round up support from Lord Drysdale to rescue his people.
