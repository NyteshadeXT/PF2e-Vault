If the web lurker didn’t respond to the battle in [[03) Ancient Rectory]], it is not expecting trouble now. Opening the ancient doors to this room makes an awful, screeching racket, however, so the adventurers can’t surprise the ettercap. 

The web lurker and three skin beetles in the northern end of the room are making no effort to hide. The ogre spiders are clinging to the ceiling, one above each of the large statues. As a result, there is a good chance they go unnoticed and surprise against the characters when battle begins. 

When the characters enter this room, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A large pool on a stone dais sits in the center of this room. Soft blue light spilling out of the pool fills the room with a dim radiance. The first things you see in that dim light are four sarcophagi arranged in a square around the pool. Three have been smashed open, but the fourth appears intact. Before you can take in anything else, movement at the far end of the room catches your eye, and you spot another of the insectlike humanoids. This one is surrounded by a small beetles. 

### Tactics 
When combat begins, the ogre spiders use drop from above, gaining surprise against players who didn't see them for this attack. The skin beetles move forward and attack the characters. The web lurker delays its action until the skin beetles have attacked. It then moves up, making sure to move adjacent to one of the beetles, and uses web net on the nearest adventurer. 

As the battle continues, the ogre spiders attack characters with their bite attacks until bloodied, at which time they climb back up and cling to the ceiling. From the ceiling, they reenter the fray with another attack from above. The skin beetles attack the characters in melee with bite attacks. The web lurker attacks the heroes in melee with venom goad and spider bite. It remains adjacent to a skin beetle or ogre spider so it can use verminous urging when the power recharges. 

### Development 
When the adventurers take the time to explore this room, describe its features fully. 

The pool is a type of scrying device. It only shows images of the lives of the dwarven heroes interred here. A character making a DC 15 [[skills#Arcana|Arcana]] or [[skills#Religion|Religion]] check while studying the pool can learn how to activate its magic. All that’s required is dipping a finger into the pool and speaking aloud the name of one of the dwarves buried here. The names of the heroes laid to rest in this room were inscribed on their sarcophagus lids, but sadly, three of them were destroyed by Hargash and his minions. Only one remains.

Any character who speaks dwarven can read the name “Ivak Stoneblood” inscribed into the lid of the intact sarcophagus. If Ivak’s name is used to activate the pool, it shows the following scenes: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A dwarven warrior in battered, scarred armor battles a group of duergar in the lightless reaches of the Underdark. He wields a mighty hammer with devastating skill. Each time its anvil-shaped head strikes a foe, it releases a flash of brilliant blue light and the duergar falls dead. 
> 
> The image fades and is replaced with a somber scene of dwarven priests interring the hammer-wielding warrior in a carved stone sarcophagus. The warrior is laid to rest with great reverence, and his hammer is laid across his chest before the lid of the sarcophagus is sealed in place. 

The crypt seen in the pool is obviously the same room where the characters stand. 

A DC 15 [[skills#Society|Society]] check reveals a little more about Ivak Stoneblood. He was famous for battling the duergar, and his hammer was reputed to be blessed by Moradin himself. 

If the heroes decide to open Ivak’s sarcophagus, it is not as easy as simply tipping off the lid. After keeping Hargash from violating the dwarven hero’s tomb, Moradin is not about to let a group of untested adventurers claim the hammer, whatever their intentions. If they wish to open the sarcophagus, characters must prove their worth to Moradin in some fashion. Until they do so, the sarcophagus can’t be opened; the power of Moradin prevents it. 

Happily, a DC 15 [[skills#Religion|Religion]] reveals at least two ways the adventurers can prove their good intentions. 
	✦ The characters can rededicate one of the altars in the rectory to Moradin. This requires one use of the holy water found in the two fonts in this room and a complexity 1 skill challenge ([[skills#Religion|Religion]] only, DC 13, 4 successes before 3 failures). 
	✦ The characters can restore one of the statues in the Hall of Honored Dead to its former condition. This requires a complexity 1 skill challenge ([[skills#Crafting|Crafting]] only, DC 13, 4 successes before 3 failures). 

If the heroes complete either or both of the skill challenges, they can then open the sarcophagus of Ivak Stoneblood. When the characters open the sarcophagus of Ivak Stoneblood, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The heavy lid of the sarcophagus slides away with a gentle push, revealing the body of a dwarven warrior dressed in crumbling, rust-pitted chainmail. Despite the decrepit state of the corpse’s armor and clothing, the stout warhammer lying across its skeletal chest looks as new as the day it was forged. 

The hammer’s head is shaped like an anvil and the steel gleams with a bluish tint. The Hammer of Ivak Stoneblood is a +1 [[striking|Striking]] [[devilblind|Devilblind]] warhammer.

### Features of the Area 
**Illumination:** The pool provides dim illumination to the entire room. 

**Ceiling:** The ceiling is 20 feet high. 

**Holy Water Fonts:** Two holy water fonts are mounted on short stone pillars in the northeast and northwest corners of the room. The power of Moradin is still strong enough in this area to prevent Hargash from turning the holy water into unholy water. A DC 15 [[skills#Arcana|Arcana]] or [[skills#Religion|Religion]] check when examining the fonts reveals that each contains a single use of holy water. This holy water has the unique property that it is effective against duergar; it inflicts damage on the tainted dwarves as if they were demons or undead. 

**Pool:** The dais the pool is mounted on is 4 feet high. It and the pool provide cover. The water in the pool is normal; the glow comes from the pool itself, which is enchanted in a manner similar to the Dark Light ritual. 

**Sarcophagi:** The smashed sarcophagi are difficult terrain. The intact sarcophagus is 4 feet high. All provide cover. A character can jump on top of the intact sarcophagus with a DC 15 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check. The three opened sarcophagi contain yellowed bones and tattered vestments in disarray. The fourth, unopened sarcophagus has the carved image of a resplendent dwarf warrior on its lid. 

**Statues:** The statues are blocking terrain and provide cover to adjacent creatures. Each is 10 feet tall. They once depicted dwarf warriors, but they have been remade to resemble great insectlike humanoids, with mandibles, multifaceted eyes, and many multi-jointed limbs.
