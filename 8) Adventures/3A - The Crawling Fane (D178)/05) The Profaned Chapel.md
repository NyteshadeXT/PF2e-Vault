Hargash’s loud, monotonous chanting makes it difficult for his minions to hear the approach of intruders, and Hargash himself is completely tuned out of his surroundings. If the characters are careful, they can enter the chapel unnoticed and gain a surprise round. If they try to enter with [[skills#Stealth|Stealth]], the shock trooper and vermin suffer a -5 penalty to their passive [[skills#perception|Perception]] thanks to Hargash’s chanting. Hargash won’t hear anything until someone attacks. 

When the characters enter this room, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> This cavernous chapel is dominated by a towering statue originally crafted as a representation of the dwarven deity Moradin. It has been crudely transformed into an image of the bizarre insect deity you’ve seen throughout the temple. Smaller statues of dwarven gods and heroes, similarly disfigured, stand against the walls. Four basins on raised platforms stand in the four corners of the chapel. A rubblechoked passage leads away to the north. 
> 
> Kneeling before the great statue of the insect god is a stout duergar in green robes. He is flanked by pair of scorpions the size of wolves, and a monstrous spider clings to the towering statue above him. Another duergar arrayed in chainmail and armed with a maul stands protectively at his back. The kneeling duergar is praying loudly in grotesque utterances of some unholy language. 

If Hargash becomes aware of the characters before they attack, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The chanting stops suddenly, and the kneeling duergar leaps to his feet and turns toward you. His gaunt face is twisted in a rictus of hatred and madness. He raises a twitching finger, points at you, and shouts in Common, “Slay them in the name of Chitteruk!” 

### Tactics 
In the first round of combat, Hargash uses verminous blast to create another insect ally and injure as many heroes as possible. The giant scorpions and the duergar shock trooper advance to engage the characters in melee. The ogre spider closes with its chosen target. In the following rounds of combat, Hargash moves just out of melee range to ensure his verminous minions can benefit from aura of Chitteruk. He targets melee-oriented adventurers with web bolt to hamper their movement and uses curse of Chitteruk as often as possible on heroes suffering ongoing poison damage. Hargash does not shrink from melee. The duergar shock trooper targets characters in combat with the scorpions attempting to flank characters to increase its chances of hitting with its maul. When bloodied, it uses enlarge and then moves adjacent to Hargash, using its reach to protect its master.

The giant scorpions attack the closest heroes in melee, relentlessly biting and stinging until slain. The ogre spider leaps about the chapel, targeting random adventurers as often as possible. When Hargash is bloodied, he and his remaining minions retreat to the pools in the northern end of the room to make use their healing powers. Hargash makes his last stand there, fighting to the death to protect the temple of his imaginary god.

### Features of the Area 
**Illumination:** The four pools in this area glow with soft red and blue light, providing dim illumination to the entire chapel. Note that all of the foes except the giant scorpions have darkvision. 

**Ceiling:** The ceiling is 30 feet high. 

**Columns:** The columns are blocking terrain. 

**Statue of Chitteruk:** The statue of Chitteruk exudes a palpable evil. Good creatures adjacent to it suffer a -1 penalty to saving throws. 

**Blue Pools:** The crystal-clear water in these pools is still blessed by Moradin. A character that drinks from one (a standard action) can immediately regain an additional 5 hit points. This can only be done once an encounter.  The water loses this property if removed from the temple. 

**Red Pools:** The murky, red water in these pools has been cursed by the dread power of the great meteorite. If Hargash drinks from one of these pools (a standard action), he regains 31 hit points. If a character, other then Cassendra, drinks from one of these pools, he or she suffers the following attack: +9 vs. Fortitude; 2d6+4 poison damage and ongoing 5 poison damage (save ends). 

**Pit:** This shallow pit is only 5 feet deep. A creature the falls into it suffers no damage but falls prone. 

**Statues:** The statues are blocking terrain and provide cover to adjacent creatures.
