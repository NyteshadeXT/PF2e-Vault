# The Hammer of Ivak Stoneblood
Torak Banehammer, a dwarven cleric of Moradin, is searching for a lost relic sacred to his faith. The relic, the Hammer of Ivak, was lost when the temple of Moradin in the Chaos Scar was destroyed. Torak believes he knows the location of the lost temple of Moradin and asks the heroes to seek it out and recover the Hammer of Ivak. To aid the characters in their endeavor, Torak offers up his own magical hammer, a +1 thundering warhammer to any hero who can wield it. 

# Big Bugs
Giant, venomous insects and other monstrous vermin have attacked and poisoned people near the King’s Wall. A druid asks the characters to obtain the venom sacks from five venomous giant bugs (centipedes, scorpions, or spiders) so she can produce an antivenom. She offers 5 gp for each venom sack obtained and promises the adventurers two doses of [[antivenom-potion-tio|Antivenom Potion]]
if they bring back at least five venom sacks. A venom sack can be recovered from a slain bug with a DC 12 [[skills#nature|Nature]] check. 

# We Aren’t Going to Take It!
The characters witness bug attacks against innocent people and decide to do something about it instead of waiting for someone to ask. Or, they themselves could come under attack by giant bugs on their way into or out of the Scar and rightly conclude that the bugs represent a larger problem... or that their lair probably contains treasure. 

In the last two cases, finding the temple is relatively easy. The characters need only watch for the bugs and follow them back to their nest.
