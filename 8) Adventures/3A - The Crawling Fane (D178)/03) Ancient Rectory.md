The two piles of rubble mark where the characters land if they drop straight down from the chasm opening. They might be concerned about landing in the loose stone, but it presents no danger (it is difficult terrain). The danger here comes from the web lurkers and duergar waiting to attack. When the first character reaches the bottom of the chasm (but hasn’t yet dropped into the room), read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The chasm ends in the ceiling of a large, brightly lit room. Directly beneath you is a pile of stones and debris that must have tumbled down when the chasm opened. 

When the first character drops into the room, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The room appears to be an ancient rectory filled with decrepit furniture, including rickety tables and chairs and a trio of beds covered with rotting blankets. A moth-eaten rug lies in the middle of the floor. Two braziers at the northern end of the room are lit and provide ample illumination. Between them stand four monstrous humanoids; two are the same as the insect-like horrors you fought above, and the other two resemble fiendish dwarves with bristly beards and glowing red eyes. That’s all you see before one of the dwarves kicks over a brazier and they all attack! 

### Tactics 
The duergar and web lurkers aren’t going to hold back until all the characters have gathered in the room. Ask for initiative rolls as soon as the first character drops in. Then the fight begins with the two duergar scouts acting immediately (they had prepared actions). The duergar on the eastern side of the room kicks over the brazier (a standard action), dousing it. The other duergar launches a crossbow bolt at the lone character in the room. Follow the normal initiative order from there. The other characters need to get down the chasm as quickly as possible. 

With half the room in shadow, the duergar scouts both use underdark sneak whenever possible. The web lurkers do not charge into battle immediately; instead they try to draw the heroes across the room and into the spiked pit trap beneath the rug. If the adventurers discover the pit trap or seem disinclined to engage the web lurkers in melee, then the web lurkers charge into melee. They rely on their claws until the invisible duergar join the fight, at which time they maneuver to gain combat advantage on a character in order to use spider bite. If a character ventures near the edge of the trap, a web lurker will try to bull rush him into the pit. 

The duergar prefer to snipe at heroes with their crossbows while invisible and save their infernal quills to hamper the attacks of enemies with powerful melee attacks. The scouts use underdark sneak as often as they are able, sticking to the shadows and staying close to a table or a bed. If forced into melee, the duergar switch to their warhammers and double-team injured characters. 

### Development 
A web lurker is stationed in the hallway beyond the ironbound doors (see tactical encounter [[04) The Hall of Honored Dead]] for details). It is reasonably alert (Perception +9) but not especially inquisitive. Make a [[skills#perception|Perception]] check (DC 22) for this web lurker at the start of each combat round, beginning with round 2. If the check succeeds three times, the web lurker finally grows curious and comes to investigate the noises from this room, which draws the creatures from area 04 into this fight. 

Once the fight ends, characters can examine the room. 

The short hallway leading to the ironbound doors is flanked by a pair of altars. Even a rudimentary examination shows that they were once dedicated to Moradin but have been grotesquely defaced. Moradin’s noble features have been replaced with a repulsive, insectoid visage that includes antennae and sharp mandibles. Extra, multi-jointed limbs have been crudely grafted to the deity’s torso. Because Chitteruk exists only in the mind of Hargash, Religion checks made to determine the identity of the insectoid deity reveal no information. 

The ironbound doors are thick and heavy but unlocked.

### Features of the Area 
**Illumination:** Bright within 5 squares of the western brazier (which burns as a torch); dim everywhere else, from light filtering down through the chasm. Dim illumination provides concealment against characters and creatures that don’t have low-light vision, darkvision, or some other sense. 

**Ceiling:** The ceiling is 10 feet high. 

**Beds, Tables, and Chairs:** The furniture is difficult terrain and provides cover. If a creature of Medium size or larger jumps onto a bed, table, or chair, it collapses and the creature must make an immediate [[skills#acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check (DC 12) to avoid falling prone. 

**Braziers:** The eastern brazier is dumped over and extinguished at the beginning of the encounter. If the remaining brazier is toppled (standard action), then the whole room is left in dim illumination. 

**Doors:** The ironbound doors at the northern end of the room are not locked. 

**Footlockers:** The ancient footlockers are still in good shape and their locks are sturdy. They can be opened with a DC 17 [[skills#thievery|Thievery]] check. One of the footlockers contains the treasure for this area. 

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> Found in the footlocker is 34 gp, *Sarkorian God-Caller Garb*, *Heartening Missive (Rabbit)* and *Eidetic Potion*.

**Rubble:** The rubble is difficult terrain.
