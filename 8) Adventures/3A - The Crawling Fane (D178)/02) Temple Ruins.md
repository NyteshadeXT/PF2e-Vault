> Before you, the crumbling shape of a long-abandoned ruin juts from the wild landscape of the Chaos Scar. The ruin stands open to the sky, and its once sturdy walls are now little more than weed-choked rubble. Two towering statues, each so weathered and eroded that its features are impossible to make out, flank what was once the main entrance. It is hard to imagine this sad, forgotten structure was once sacred to the faith of Moradin.

Thanks to his many insect spies, Hargash is aware whenever intruders approach the temple ruins. As soon as the heroes enter the ruins, Hargash completes a powerful ritual that shakes and cracks the earth. The ritual opens a chasm in the ground that connects with the subterranean sections of the ruined temple. From this chasm climb web lurkers and poisonous centipedes, servants of Hargash and his god Chitteruk. When Hargash completes his ritual, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The air is suddenly filled with the grating rumble of rock. The earth splits into a gaping chasm not far from where you stand. The ground beneath your feet bucks like some colossal, angry beast, and you must struggle to keep your balance. 

Each character must make a Reflex save (DC 11) to avoid being knocked prone. The shaking stops on the following round, and moments later, web lurkers and centipedes swarm out of the chasm created by the ritual to attack the adventurers. 

### Tactics
In the first round of combat, the web lurkers and centipedes focus their attacks on characters who were knocked prone by the earthquake. As battle continues, the centipede swarms gang up on a single hero to increase the damage output of their swarm aura. The web lurkers use web to immobilize characters and increase the damage from their melee attacks. In the first rounds of combat, the web lurkers try to flank adventurers in order to use their spider bite attack, switching to their claws after a successful bite.

### Developments
When the adventurers approach the crevasse, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The ground has split open, revealing a deep chasm that descends into darkness. A faint glimmer of light is visible at the bottom, but it is impossible to gauge the distance from the light to where you stand at the top of the rift. The walls of the chasm are jagged with protruding stones and the gnarled roots of trees; certainly enough handholds to make for a fairly easy climb. 

The chasm drops 30 feet to the floor of the temple ruins below. It is fairly easy to climb, requiring only a DC 12 [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] check; there is, however, a 10-foot drop from the rectoryâ€™s ceiling to the floor, so heroes with no training in Acrobatics need to lower a rope or take `dice: 1d10` damage from the fall. 

### Features of the Area 
**Illumination:** Daylight

**Chasm:** The chasm plunges 30 feet down to the floor of the rectory. The walls can be climbed with a DC 12 [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] check. 

**Rubble:** The rubble in this area is difficult terrain. 

**Statues:** The statues are blocking terrain and provide cover to adjacent creatures. 

**Walls:** The walls range from 5 to 8 feet in height. They can be climbed with a DC 12 [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] check. The tops of the walls are narrow and crumbling; characters moving atop the walls must succeed at a DC 12 [[skills#acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check; the character falls prone atop the wall with a result of 6-9, or falls to the ground with a result of 5 or less.
