# Adventure Summary
Once a year, Harley invites (or ensnares) the heroes into her whimsical pocket realm for mischief and treats.  

This year, however, something is wrong. Her **lantern—heart of her realm’s light and joy—has cracked**, bleeding out threads of shadow that warp her world. Through it, she can glimpse **the red meteor sent by Kataclysmos**, an omen she cannot ignore.  

Unable to leave her realm or repair the Lantern herself, Harley calls upon her favorite mortals once more.  

If the Lantern’s corruption spreads, her realm—and the joyful spirit of Halloween itself—will collapse into eternal night.

# Encounter 1: A Light Dimming
**Encounter Difficulty:**   
- [ ] Severe (90 XP) Level 14

![[Halloween Harley.webp|left wmed]]

This adventure begins on **All Hallows Eve**, just as the heroes are wrapping up their day near the **Chaos Scar**. 

The boundary between worlds weakens at this time each year, allowing Harley’s pocket realm to reach out and “invite” (or ensnare) those she finds most entertaining.  

Unlike previous years, her call feels strained and desperate—tinged with the same crimson hue that marks the meteor’s slow approach to Aetheria.

> [!note]+ Read Aloud - The Invitation
> The night sky deepens into velvet black, the wind carrying a faint chill and the scent of burnt sugar and smoke. A low hum rises, like the drone of distant music boxes winding themselves awake.
> 
> Then, the moonlight changes. A reddish glow pulses through the clouds, bathing the land in a strange twilight. Shadows stretch unnaturally long, their edges flickering like candle flames.
> 
> One of those shadows begins to move. It pools before you, swirling into a circle of amber light etched with runes that twist between warmth and decay. The air smells faintly of caramel apples and grave soil.
> 
> From the glowing circle, a familiar, lilting voice calls out—uneasy, but unmistakably Harley’s. “Hello, my dears… I—I didn’t mean to summon you like this, but it seems the veil is thinner than I thought. Oh, bother! Just hold still a moment, will you?”
> 
> The circle flares bright orange for a heartbeat before collapsing inward, pulling you with it as though gravity itself turned sideways. The world bends, twists, and then— You find yourselves standing beneath a sky of swirling violet clouds. Fields of pumpkins stretch out endlessly, but their vines are wilted, their leaves blackened at the edges.
> 
> A crackling sound draws your attention to a nearby hill, where a massive iron-and-glass lantern taller than a cottage flickers erratically. One of its panels is shattered, leaking a steady stream of shadow that burns with a faint crimson edge.
> 
> Harley stands beside it, her hands raised in vain as she tries to repair it. Her usual festive orange-and-black attire is dimmed, her expression uncharacteristically serious. “It’s the Lantern,” she says softly as she notices you. “The heart of my realm. It cracked a few nights ago—and now things are… leaking through.”

Allow Harley a short conversation here. She should deliver key exposition in her usual whimsical tone, but with visible worry beneath it. Adjust the pacing based on how quickly your players grasp what’s happening.

**Summary of What She Explains:**
- The Lantern sustains her pocket realm and embodies the _spirit of Hallows Eve_ itself.
- It cracked when a strange red star appeared in her sky.
- Ever since, “the shadows that don’t belong” have been slipping through, hungry and wild.
- She can’t repair it alone — her own magic rebounds against the crack, threatening to consume her if she forces it.

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> “Every year I come to play—tricks and treats, fright and fun. But this… this isn’t play. The Lantern connects the Season in all worlds. When it cracked, it _bled_, and the shadows came crawling in.”
> 
> She looks up at the crimson star burning faintly through the clouds.  “And that light—it’s not from my world. I can _feel_ it watching. You see it too, don’t you? The red one that even the gods pretend not to notice? I think it’s… his doing.”
> 
> She shakes her head and forces a smile. “Never mind that now. If I can patch the Lantern from the outside while you hold back the things trying to crawl out—well, then maybe this old Hallows Eve can still be saved.”

![[Halloween 2025 - The Cracked Lantern-1761596014080.webp|right wmed]]

At that cue, the Lantern flares, marking the beginning of combat.

> [!note]+ Read Aloud  - The Lantern Awakens
> The Lantern pulses with a deep, resonant hum. Cracks along its surface glow red, and from within, you see shapes—something moving in the shadow. The air vibrates with a sound like cracking glass.
> 
> Harley stumbles back, her eyes wide. “No! Not yet—it’s not ready!”
> 
> The Lantern shatters outward in a spray of molten light. Two winged forms burst free—draconic creatures of shadow and flame, their scales reflecting orange lantern-light at the edges. Between them coils a shifting, formless mass of darkness, whispering in a language that hurts to hear.
> 
> “They’re pieces of it,” Harley gasps. “The Lantern’s _heartlight_—twisted!”
> 
> The wyrmlings shriek, arcs of red-black flame spilling from their jaws as they circle the field. The ground beneath you buckles with rippling shadows. Harley raises her staff and points: “Protect the Lantern! If it breaks, the whole realm could unravel!”

```encounter
name: A Light Dimming
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 2: [[Shadow Drake (Ancient), Lantern Wyrmling]]
- 1: [[Lantern Fragment]]
- 1: Creeping Shadowflame, hidden
```

## Tactics
The wyrmlings swoop and breathe arcs of red-tinged fire, targeting clusters of PCs. The lantern fragment moves between them, using concealment from dim light to ambush casters. If reduced to half HP, one wyrmling attempts to dive into the Lantern’s crack, forcing the PCs to decide whether to risk damaging the Lantern to stop it.

## Features of the Area
**The Lantern (Object, AC 28, Hardness 15, HP 75):** Emits dim light in 30 ft. If destroyed, the realm destabilizes, forcing all creatures to make a DC 33 Reflex save or take `dice: 10d6` 10d6 force damage and be knocked prone as the realm convulses.
**Creeping Shadowfire:** Each round on initiative 20, the crack leaks a wave of red-black flame in a 20-ft burst (`dice: 8d6` 8d6 fire damage, Reflex DC 31 half).
**Glass and Embers:** Around the base of the lantern is fallen glass shards and glowing embers creating an area of difficult terrain in a 10 ft radius.

# Encounter 2: The Mirror Parade
**Encounter Difficulty:**   
- [ ] Severe (90 XP) Level 14

![[Halloween 2025 - The Cracked Lantern-1761596406967.webp|right wmed]]

After the Lantern Wyrm collapses and the corrupted energies recoil back into the Lantern, the realm grows unnervingly quiet. Harley looks toward the far horizon, where the crimson hue still pulses faintly through the violet clouds.

> [!note]+ Read Aloud  
> The air smells of singed glass and smoke. The massive Lantern hums quietly behind you, its cracks faintly sealed, but a sliver of red light still pulses deep within like a slow heartbeat.
> 
> Harley exhales and twirls her staff once, the gesture oddly subdued.  “That’s one fire smothered… but the smoke always finds a new way to crawl.”
> 
> She points toward the west. There, beyond a ridge of pumpkin-strewn hills, you can make out strange flickers of color — orange, violet, green — accompanied by the faint sound of carnival music, warped and sluggish, as if played on instruments made of bone and rust.
> 
> “Oh, not _there_,” she mutters, grimacing. “The Parade. It shouldn’t have started. Something’s _marching_ without me.”
> 
> She looks back to you with that uneasy grin attempting to hide her fear.  “Best we check the floats before they check _us_, hm?”

Harley waves her hand, opening a narrow ribbon of orange light through the air — a path of lantern-flame that arcs like a bridge across the darkened fields.  

The players can choose to follow her directly or scout ahead. As they travel, the path beneath them flickers with scenes of past Halloweens: children laughing, pumpkins glowing, the faint echo of fireworks. But the colors fade as they approach the sound of the parade.

> [!note]+ Read Aloud  
> The rolling fields give way to cobblestone streets lit by broken lanterns and curling fog. A great midway stretches before you, its banners torn and faded. Stalls line the streets — games long abandoned, prizes melted or twisted into grotesque forms. The scent of popcorn and candlewax mingles with decay.
> 
> Ahead, the road widens into a grand thoroughfare. There, an eerie procession marches endlessly: floats of silvered mirrors that drift inches above the ground, spinning slowly. Reflections flicker in their glass surfaces — twisted, hollow-eyed versions of carnival revelers — and surrounding them are tall, thin figures wearing featureless mirrored masks.
> 
> Each mask glints with dim light, catching your movements as though following your every step.
> 
> Harley’s whisper carries over the music. “Those... are not mine. The Mirror Men. Echoes from the realm between reflections. When the Lantern cracked, it must have drawn _them_ here.”

The lights dim further, and the carnival music slows until it sounds like a heartbeat. Then, one mirror turns to face the party — though no one touched it.

> [!note]+ Read Aloud  
> The nearest float halts abruptly. Its mirrored panels ripple like disturbed water. From within, pale hands press outward, bending the glass as though it were thin silk.
> 
> The mirrored surface bursts outward, scattering shards that hover mid-air before reforming into humanoid shapes of reflective glass and smoke. Their movements are jerky, puppet-like, but every turn of their heads perfectly mimics _yours_.

```encounter
name: The Mirror Parade
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 3: [[Mirror Man]]
- 1: [[Parade Master of Glass]]
```

## Tactics
The Mirror Men emerge from two floats and flank while the Parade Master rises on another, surveying the party silently.

At half health, the Parade Master uses _Shatter March_ to reposition and split the party.

## Features of the Area
**Carnival Street:** The broad parade route is lined with half-melted floats and collapsed tents that provide cover (standard rules).
**Mirrored Floats:** Four large mirror structures float 5 ft above the ground (AC 30, Hardness 10, HP 50). Breaking one causes a 10-ft burst of dazzling light (DC 32 Fort save or Blinded 1 round).
**Harley’s Actions:** Each round she attempts to stabilize reflections that threaten to spill into other realms (Arcana or Occultism DC 30). If a PC Assists successfully, one Mirror Man loses its reaction until the start of its next turn.

When the Parade Master dies, his shards rise and burst into glittering dust. Harley gathers one between her fingers.

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> “A piece of my joy, twisted and returned. The Lantern’s cracks are calling them home.”

# Encounter 3: Heart of the Lantern
**Encounter Difficulty:**   
- [ ] Severe (140 XP) Level 14

![[Halloween 2025 - The Cracked Lantern-1761597678222.webp|left wmed]]

The street of mirrors collapses inward after the Parade Master’s defeat. Shattered reflections swirl like dying fireflies, each fragment showing the Lantern pulsing crimson in the distance.

> [!note]+ Read Aloud  
> The mirrored shards drift upward, aligning into a faint outline of the Lantern against the violet sky. Its light flares, a deep scarlet heartbeat that shakes the ground. Harley watches the image, her usual sparkle gone. “It’s calling to me,” she whispers. “Or maybe… to what’s _left_ of me.”
> 
> The glow intensifies until the horizon itself burns red. A tremor rolls beneath your feet, and from far off you hear the Lantern _crack_ — a sound like glass shattering inside your skull. Harley straightens, determination cutting through her fear. “That’s where it ends. If the Lantern breaks again, it won’t just swallow _my_ world.”
> 
> She gestures, tracing a path of orange fire through the mist. “Follow the light, loves. Before the dark learns to walk.”

Bridges of molten glass rise from the void, carrying the party back across the distorted fields toward the Lantern’s hill. The night above has changed — the crimson star burns closer now, bleeding through even this pocket realm.

> [!note]+ Read Aloud  
> The Lantern towers before you once more, its frame warped and blackened. The crack that once leaked faint light now blazes red-white, veins of fire crawling across its surface. The fields around it are ash and shadow.  Harley’s voice trembles as she approaches. “It’s feeding on me — on every spark I’ve ever given this place. If I step inside, it’ll devour what’s left of the Season.”
> 
> She turns to you with a pleading smile. “But you can go where I can’t. The Lantern knows you. It remembers your light.”
> 
> She plants her staff into the soil. The runes along it flare, and a spiral of gold and violet energy forms around her feet. “I’ll hold the gateway open until the heart is clean.”

The Lantern’s light folds inward, and the world inverts — drawing you through its blazing crack into the realm within.

> [!note]+ Read Aloud  
> You fall through endless radiance, landing softly on a floating platform of mirrored glass. Shards drift all around, each reflecting pieces of Harley’s world — pumpkin fields, candlelight, children laughing — then twisting into fire and ash.
> 
> At the center of this fragmented void looms a colossal silhouette: Harley’s own form, distorted and burning from within. Her laughter and sobs overlap, echoing like wind through broken bells.
> 
> “You came,” she says in Harley’s voice — but wrong, layered with something ancient and cruel. “Then you’ll break with me.”

The fractured light around her begins to coalesce. Glowing shards detach from the floating platforms, twisting into humanoid forms — **Lantern Fragments**, born from the Lantern’s shattered light.

> [!note]+ Read Aloud  
> The shards flare to life, swirling around Harley’s Shadow like satellites. Each gleams gold for a heartbeat before turning crimson. Their motion is perfect, synchronized — a mockery of order forged from ruin.

```encounter
name: Heart of the Lantern
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 2: [[Lantern Fragment]] 
- 1: [[Shadow Harley]]
- 1: Crimson Resonance, Hidden
```


## Tactics
The Fragments open with ranged bursts, forcing the party to move across shifting platforms while Harley’s Shadow uses her Crimson Surge and Draining Gaze to split the group. 

At half HP, she shatters the platform network (creating 4 zones of difficult terrain, [[skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] DC 28 to cross). 

Harley’s essence fuels the Lantern; its corruption feeds directly on her power. If she steps inside, the crimson energy will consume her joy and turn her fully into the Shadow.  Outside, she anchors a ritual to stabilize the Lantern’s shell and keep the portal open. Each minute inside is a strain on her life force.  Occasionally, her voice echoes through the cracks:

> [!note]+ Read Aloud  
> “You’re doing beautifully… don’t let the light go out!”

If the fight lasts more than 7 rounds, her ritual starts to fail — the crimson resonance triggers each round.

## Features of the Area
**Crimson Resonance** At initiative 20 each round, roll a `dice: 1d6` to determine the effect:

|     |                                                                                                              |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1–2 | **Shadowflame Burst:** 60-ft burst `dice: 6d6` fire + `dice: 6d6` negative damage (Ref DC 33 half).          |
| 3–4 | **Gravity Inversion:** Platforms tilt; Ref DC 31 or fall prone and slide 10 ft. in a random direction.       |
| 5–6 | **Mirror Feedback:** Bright light sources within 20 ft explode (`dice: 8d6` mental damage, Will DC 33 half). | 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud  
> With a final shrieking laugh, Harley’s Shadow fractures into a thousand flaming shards. Each fragment races back into the Lantern’s core, and for a heartbeat the world is blinding white.
> 
> Then, silence. The crimson light gutters out, leaving only a soft amber glow. The drifting glass settles into stillness, and you feel a gentle pull upward — the Lantern’s light folding the world back into itself.
> 
> You stand once more in the pumpkin fields. The Lantern towers above, whole again and radiant with golden fire. Harley kneels beside it, her aura dim but warm.
> 
> “My dears,” she says with a tired smile, “you saved more than just the Season tonight.” With a snap of her fingers, a long banquet table appears beside the Lantern — piled high with candied apples, sugared pastries, and steaming mugs of cider. Soft music rises on the wind, carried by laughter that feels lighter now, unburdened.
> 
> “Trick and treat — both well earned.”
> 
> For a time, you’re allowed to rest. The autumn breeze carries the scent of roasted pumpkin and spiced sugar. Harley wanders between you, offering kind words and curious gifts.

## **Harley’s Banquet of Masks and Miracles**

> [!note]+ Read Aloud  
> The long harvest table gleams under the restored Lantern’s light. Silver bells chime softly as Harley raises her staff, and each candle flickers into the shape of a tiny, smiling face.
> 
> “Now then, my lovely heroes — every Hallows’ Eve needs its parting favors! A trick for the brave, a treat for the kind, and a little mischief for those caught in between.”
> 
> She sweeps her hand, and four gifts appear upon the table — each resting on black velvet, glowing faintly beneath the Lantern’s amber shine.


### **The Jack O’ Lantern Mask**
> [!note]+ Read Aloud  
> Harley gestures to a carved pumpkin mask whose grin burns with inner fire.
> 
> “For those who face the dark and make it laugh back — a smile to terrify the terrors themselves. Wear it proudly, and let your laughter set the night ablaze. The fearful need reminding: not all fire consumes; some protects.”
> 
> The mask’s hollow eyes spark for a moment, echoing Harley’s own mischievous glint.

### **The Mask of the Porcelain Pretender**
> [!note]+ Read Aloud  
> Next, she unveils a smooth white mask, its painted smile perfect and unsettling.
> 
> “Ah, the little liar. Polished, polite, and perfectly convincing. This one hides truths with artistry, not malice — though I warn you, darlings, it _does_ love an audience. Every fib told through it earns a wider grin, so use it for wit, not wickedness.”
> 
> The porcelain gleam reflects the Lantern’s light like moonlight on still water.

### **Harley’s Treat of Dread**
> [!note]+ Read Aloud  
> Harley lifts a goblet filled with flickering crimson cider, steam curling into tiny flame-eyed pumpkins.
> 
> “For my bold ones — who stare fear in the eye and toast it. A sip of this will set your heart alight and your enemies trembling. Remember, courage isn’t the absence of fear — it’s making fear dance to your tune.”
> 
> She raises her own glass with a devilish wink before setting it beside you.

### **Harley’s Treat of Joy**
> [!note]+ Read Aloud  
> Finally, she reveals a crystal bottle of golden cider that glows like dawn. The scent of sugar and pumpkin spice fills the air.
> 
> “And for those who fight with laughter instead of blades — a draught of delight. It’ll keep the chill of despair far from your heart and share your joy with every soul nearby. The world needs a few more smiles, don’t you think?”
> 
> The Lantern brightens as she speaks, its light dancing through the bottle like sunrise through stained glass.
> 
> She raises her mug toward you in toast. “To the brave hearts who keep the dark at bay — even mine.” When the laughter fades and the last candles burn low, Harley glances up at the sky. The crimson star still burns above — no longer distant, but bright enough to cast its own pale light.
> 
> “It’s closer now,” she whispers. “I can see it even from here. The others still don’t believe me. But you do… don’t you?”

## **Harley’s Final Gift — The Ember of Tomorrow**
> [!note]+ Read Aloud  
> “One more thing,” she says softly. “A secret between us. The others won’t listen, but...”
> 
> “Before you go,” she says quietly, “there’s one last thing I can give you.”
> 
> She cups her hands, and a spark of pure golden fire flickers between them. The air around her grows still as the Lantern’s light bends inward, feeding the flame. When she opens her hands, a tiny glass charm floats above her palm — a teardrop of starlight swirling with warm amber hues.
> 
> “An **Ember of Tomorrow**,” she whispers. “A promise that life will not end easily. Should the worst befall us, this little light will defy the dark — for one life, one time, no more.”
> 
> She looks to each of you in turn, her smile trembling. “I can’t say whose light it should guard. That choice belongs to you, my heroes. Give it to the one you cannot bear to lose — or keep it close until the world itself decides.”
> 
> The charm drifts forward, hovering between you, its glow reflected in Harley’s eyes. “Take it,” she says softly. “And remember — even when the sky burns red, there’s still time for one more tomorrow.”
> 
> She smiles then — wistful, knowing — and waves her hand. The fields shimmer, the table and Lantern dissolving into starlight. “Go on, my darlings. The night is ending, and you’ve earned your dawn.”
> 
> Her laughter follows, soft and sweet, as the world folds away. You find yourselves once again beneath familiar skies, the scent of autumn still lingering in the air — and, just for a moment, the faint echo of laughter drifting on the wind.
