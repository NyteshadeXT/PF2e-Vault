# Adventure Summary
Once a year, Harley invites (or ensnares) the heroes into her whimsical pocket realm for mischief and treats.  

This year, however, something is wrong. Her **lantern—heart of her realm’s light and joy—has cracked**, bleeding out threads of shadow that warp her world. Through it, she can glimpse **the red meteor sent by Kataclysmos**, an omen she cannot ignore.  

Unable to leave her realm or repair the Lantern herself, Harley calls upon her favorite mortals once more.  

If the Lantern’s corruption spreads, her realm—and the joyful spirit of Halloween itself—will collapse into eternal night.

# Encounter 1: A Light Dimming
**Encounter Difficulty:**   
- [ ] Moderate (80 XP) Level 14

This adventure begins on **All Hallows Eve**, just as the heroes are wrapping up their day near the **Chaos Scar**. 

The boundary between worlds weakens at this time each year, allowing Harley’s pocket realm to reach out and “invite” (or ensnare) those she finds most entertaining.  

Unlike previous years, her call feels strained and desperate—tinged with the same crimson hue that marks the meteor’s slow approach to Aetheria.

> [!note]+ Read Aloud - The Invitation
> The night sky deepens into velvet black, the wind carrying a faint chill and the scent of burnt sugar and smoke. A low hum rises, like the drone of distant music boxes winding themselves awake.
> 
> Then, the moonlight changes. A reddish glow pulses through the clouds, bathing the land in a strange twilight. Shadows stretch unnaturally long, their edges flickering like candle flames.
> 
> One of those shadows begins to move. It pools before you, swirling into a circle of amber light etched with runes that twist between warmth and decay. The air smells faintly of caramel apples and grave soil.
> 
> From the glowing circle, a familiar, lilting voice calls out—uneasy, but unmistakably Harley’s. “Hello, my dears… I—I didn’t mean to summon you like this, but it seems the veil is thinner than I thought. Oh, bother! Just hold still a moment, will you?”
> 
> The circle flares bright orange for a heartbeat before collapsing inward, pulling you with it as though gravity itself turned sideways. The world bends, twists, and then— You find yourselves standing beneath a sky of swirling violet clouds. Fields of pumpkins stretch out endlessly, but their vines are wilted, their leaves blackened at the edges.
> 
> A crackling sound draws your attention to a nearby hill, where a massive iron-and-glass lantern taller than a cottage flickers erratically. One of its panels is shattered, leaking a steady stream of shadow that burns with a faint crimson edge.
> 
> Harley stands beside it, her hands raised in vain as she tries to repair it. Her usual festive orange-and-black attire is dimmed, her expression uncharacteristically serious. “It’s the Lantern,” she says softly as she notices you. “The heart of my realm. It cracked a few nights ago—and now things are… leaking through.”

Allow Harley a short conversation here. She should deliver key exposition in her usual whimsical tone, but with visible worry beneath it. Adjust the pacing based on how quickly your players grasp what’s happening.

**Summary of What She Explains:**
- The Lantern sustains her pocket realm and embodies the _spirit of Hallows Eve_ itself.
- It cracked when a strange red star appeared in her sky.
- Ever since, “the shadows that don’t belong” have been slipping through, hungry and wild.
- She can’t repair it alone — her own magic rebounds against the crack, threatening to consume her if she forces it.

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> “Every year I come to play—tricks and treats, fright and fun. But this… this isn’t play. The Lantern connects the Season in all worlds. When it cracked, it _bled_, and the shadows came crawling in.”
> 
> She looks up at the crimson star burning faintly through the clouds.  “And that light—it’s not from my world. I can _feel_ it watching. You see it too, don’t you? The red one that even the gods pretend not to notice? I think it’s… his doing.”
> 
> She shakes her head and forces a smile. “Never mind that now. If I can patch the Lantern from the outside while you hold back the things trying to crawl out—well, then maybe this old Hallows Eve can still be saved.”

At that cue, the Lantern flares, marking the beginning of combat.

> [!note]+ Read Aloud  - The Lantern Awakens
> The Lantern pulses with a deep, resonant hum. Cracks along its surface glow red, and from within, you see shapes—something moving in the shadow. The air vibrates with a sound like cracking glass.
> 
> Harley stumbles back, her eyes wide. “No! Not yet—it’s not ready!”
> 
> The Lantern shatters outward in a spray of molten light. Two winged forms burst free—draconic creatures of shadow and flame, their scales reflecting orange lantern-light at the edges. Between them coils a shifting, formless mass of darkness, whispering in a language that hurts to hear.
> 
> “They’re pieces of it,” Harley gasps. “The Lantern’s _heartlight_—twisted!”
> 
> The wyrmlings shriek, arcs of red-black flame spilling from their jaws as they circle the field. The ground beneath you buckles with rippling shadows. Harley raises her staff and points: “Protect the Lantern! If it breaks, the whole realm could unravel!”

```encounter
name: A Light Dimming
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 2: [[Shadow Drake (Ancient), Lantern Wyrmling]]
- 1: [[Lantern Fragment]]
- 1: Creeping Shadowflame, hidden
```

## Tactics
The wyrmlings swoop and breathe arcs of red-tinged fire, targeting clusters of PCs. The lantern fragment moves between them, using concealment from dim light to ambush casters. If reduced to half HP, one wyrmling attempts to dive into the Lantern’s crack, forcing the PCs to decide whether to risk damaging the Lantern to stop it.

## Features of the Area
**The Lantern (Object, AC 28, Hardness 15, HP 75):** Emits dim light in 30 ft. If destroyed, the realm destabilizes, forcing all creatures to make a DC 33 Reflex save or take `dice: 10d6` 10d6 force damage and be knocked prone as the realm convulses.
**Creeping Shadowfire:** Each round on initiative 20, the crack leaks a **wave of red-black flame** in a 20-ft burst (8d6 fire damage, Reflex DC 31 half).
**Glass and Embers:** Around the base of the lantern is fallen glass shards and glowing embers creating an area of difficult terrain in a 10 ft radius.

# Encounter 2: The Mirror Parade
**Encounter Difficulty:**   
- [x] Severe (90 XP) Level 14

After the Lantern Wyrm collapses and the corrupted energies recoil back into the Lantern, the realm grows unnervingly quiet. Harley looks toward the far horizon, where the crimson hue still pulses faintly through the violet clouds.

> [!note]+ Read Aloud  
> The air smells of singed glass and smoke. The massive Lantern hums quietly behind you, its cracks faintly sealed, but a sliver of red light still pulses deep within like a slow heartbeat.
> 
> Harley exhales and twirls her staff once, the gesture oddly subdued.  “That’s one fire smothered… but the smoke always finds a new way to crawl.”
> 
> She points toward the west. There, beyond a ridge of pumpkin-strewn hills, you can make out strange flickers of color — orange, violet, green — accompanied by the faint sound of carnival music, warped and sluggish, as if played on instruments made of bone and rust.
> 
> “Oh, not _there_,” she mutters, grimacing. “The Parade. It shouldn’t have started. Something’s _marching_ without me.”
> 
> She looks back to you with that uneasy grin attempting to hide her fear.  “Best we check the floats before they check _us_, hm?”

Harley waves her hand, opening a narrow ribbon of orange light through the air — a path of lantern-flame that arcs like a bridge across the darkened fields.  

The players can choose to follow her directly or scout ahead. As they travel, the path beneath them flickers with scenes of past Halloweens: children laughing, pumpkins glowing, the faint echo of fireworks. But the colors fade as they approach the sound of the parade.

> [!note]+ Read Aloud  
> The rolling fields give way to cobblestone streets lit by broken lanterns and curling fog. A great midway stretches before you, its banners torn and faded. Stalls line the streets — games long abandoned, prizes melted or twisted into grotesque forms. The scent of popcorn and candlewax mingles with decay.
> 
> Ahead, the road widens into a grand thoroughfare. There, an eerie procession marches endlessly: floats of silvered mirrors that drift inches above the ground, spinning slowly. Reflections flicker in their glass surfaces — twisted, hollow-eyed versions of carnival revelers — and surrounding them are tall, thin figures wearing featureless mirrored masks.
> 
> Each mask glints with dim light, catching your movements as though following your every step.
> 
> Harley’s whisper carries over the music. “Those... are not mine. The Mirror Men. Echoes from the realm between reflections. When the Lantern cracked, it must have drawn _them_ here.”

The lights dim further, and the carnival music slows until it sounds like a heartbeat. Then, one mirror turns to face the party — though no one touched it.

> [!note]+ Read Aloud  
> The nearest float halts abruptly. Its mirrored panels ripple like disturbed water. From within, pale hands press outward, bending the glass as though it were thin silk.
> 
> The mirrored surface bursts outward, scattering shards that hover mid-air before reforming into humanoid shapes of reflective glass and smoke. Their movements are jerky, puppet-like, but every turn of their heads perfectly mimics _yours_.

```encounter
name: The Mirror Parade
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 3: [[Mirror Man]]
- 1: [[Parade Master of Glass]]
```

## Tactics
The Mirror Men emerge from two floats and flank while the Parade Master rises on another, surveying the party silently.

At half health, the Parade Master uses _Shatter March_ to reposition and split the party.

## Features of the Area
**Carnival Street:** The broad parade route is lined with half-melted floats and collapsed tents that provide cover (standard rules).
**Mirrored Floats:** Four large mirror structures float 5 ft above the ground (AC 30, Hardness 10, HP 50). Breaking one causes a 10-ft burst of dazzling light (DC 32 Fort save or Blinded 1 round).
**Harley’s Actions:** Each round she attempts to stabilize reflections that threaten to spill into other realms (Arcana or Occultism DC 30). If a PC Assists successfully, one Mirror Man loses its reaction until the start of its next turn.

When the Parade Master dies, his shards rise and burst into glittering dust. Harley gathers one between her fingers.

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> “A piece of my joy, twisted and returned. The Lantern’s cracks are calling them home.”

# Encounter 3: Heart of the Lantern
**Encounter Difficulty:**   
- [x] Severe (120 XP) Level 14

After the defeat of the Parade Master of Glass, the carnival collapses into silence. The broken mirrors along the street flicker faintly, showing distorted images of Harley’s Lantern, each reflection trembling as though in pain. The air smells faintly of ozone and burnt sugar again — the signature scent of her realm unraveling.

> [!note]+ Read Aloud  
> The final shards of the Parade Master’s form float upward, shimmering like dying embers. As they rise, they begin to align in mid-air, forming a ghostly outline of the great Lantern you first saw — only now its light burns red at the core.
> 
> Harley stares at the image, her usual levity gone. “It’s calling to me,” she murmurs. “Or… to _something else._”
> 
> The image flickers violently, and you feel a pulse — a heartbeat — ripple through the ground beneath your feet. In the distance, across the endless pumpkin fields, the real Lantern flares with crimson light, splitting the clouds overhead like a wound in the sky.
> 
> Harley turns to you, face pale but determined. “That’s where this ends. My Lantern’s heart is bleeding into the space between worlds — and something’s crawling _through_ the crack.”

As they travel, the landscape beneath them fades away into mist, revealing glimpses of Aetheria’s night sky — and, faintly, the red meteor, now much closer and visible even here within Harley’s pocket realm.

> [!note]+ Read Aloud  
> When you arrive, the great Lantern no longer glows with its warm amber light. Its surface has blackened, cracks glowing red-white like veins of magma. The once-gentle pulse now thrums like a drumbeat of war. The pumpkin fields surrounding it have withered, the vines turned to ash.
> 
> Harley stands at its base, her fingers trembling as she lifts her staff. “It’s not just my magic anymore,” she says quietly. “Something _from beyond_ has taken hold inside. If I enter, I’ll feed it more power. It’s feeding on me — on every Halloween, every spark of joy that made this place.”
> 
> She glances back at you, a flicker of both fear and trust in her eyes. “But you’re not bound to it. You can go where I cannot. Find the core, shatter whatever’s growing inside, and I’ll anchor you here so the Lantern doesn’t collapse.”

The Lantern’s light swells once more — and then, like a collapsing star, it inverts. The world stretches, twists, and you’re pulled inside.

Inside, space folds into an impossible chamber: a floating void of fractured glass platforms, each shard reflecting scenes from Harley’s realm — the pumpkin fields, the parade, even your own faces distorted in eerie smiles.

> [!note]+ Read Aloud  
> You fall through silence, landing gently on a glass platform suspended in endless space. Around you, other shards of glass drift slowly, reflecting pale orange and crimson light. Each surface ripples like liquid, showing fragments of Harley’s world — and deep within one of them, you see her Lantern’s heart, beating like a dying sun.
> 
> Tendrils of red shadow snake between the shards, feeding into a single massive silhouette — a being that shifts constantly, part Harley, part something else. Her voice echoes faintly, doubled and distorted:
> 
> “I… see you. You should not have come.”
> 
> Then the reflection tears itself free from the nearest shard — _Harley’s Shadow_, wreathed in crimson flame and leaking trails of black glass.

```encounter
name: Heart of the Lantern
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 2: [[Lantern Fragment]] 
- 1: [[Savage Fiendblood Minotaur]]
```


## Tactics
The Hezrou want to separate the heroes, so they attempt to Grab them and then [[dimension-door|Dimension Door]] outside the tower through the arrow slits. 

The demonic savage minotaur runs up through the interior of the head and the tower to engage the first enemy it sees.

## Features of the Area
**Attacking from The Head in the Clouds:** A creature can make attacks out of the eyes of the head, but the eyes are about 60 feet above the ground. Similarly, creatures within the tower are 100 feet, 115 feet, or 130 feet above the ground. Regardless of where the creatures are in the head or the tower, targets within 20 feet of the head have total cover. Only creatures leaning over the edge of roof of the first level of the tower can get a clear shot at targets within 20 feet of the side of the head.
**Climbing The Head in the Clouds:** A creature can climb the head with a DC 31 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check. Climbing the side of the tower requires a DC 33 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check.
**Bookcases:** A bookcase might be pushed over onto the 2-by-4-square area adjacent to it. if so, the pusher makes a Strength +12 attack at creatures in the area.   On a hit, the creature takes 1d8 + Strength modifier damage and falls prone. On a miss, the creature slides to the nearest open space.
**Magic Glyphs:** Any non-elemental creature that ends its turn in a square of a glyph suffers the following:
- **Blue Glyph**—`dice: 6d6` cold damage, and the creature is [[conditions#Slowed|Slowed 1]].
- **Red Glyph**—`dice: 4d8` fire damage.
- **Golden Glyph**—`dice: 3d12` damage, and a –2 penalty to all defenses (save ends).

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> Bolios gives the characters much of his wealth and belongings for defending him and driving off the attackers.  This includes 20 pp, 200 gp, 390 sp, an [[throwing-knife-ec1|Unholy Weapon Potency +2 Throwing Knife]], a [[2) compendium/equipment/items/Homebrew/energy-resistant|Runestone: Energy-Resistant]], a [[boulder-seed-tv|Boulder Seed]] and two scrolls.

# Concluding the Adventure
If Bolios survives, he’s grateful to the adventurers and begs them to help get him and his library out of the Chaos Scar. The minotaurs’ bodies might reveal some clue as to why they wanted The Head in the Clouds, 
but why that is and what adventures it might lead the characters to is up to you.

Although Bolios strengthened the bonds on the elementals in his ship, he doesn’t know how to recapture them or bond new elemental creatures. Once he has had time to do some research with his books, he’ll be happy to hire the characters to seek and capture some elementals to repower The Head in the Clouds (and probably to chase out whatever creatures inevitably move into the head after Bolios and the characters strip it of valuables and leave the Scar). As payment for these deeds, Bolios gives the characters the rest of his wealth and takes them wherever they wish to go, plus he offers to give them another free ride at a later date.

If Bolios didn’t survive, the heroes might be able to research the means of re-powering the head themselves from Bolios’s library, but they must either get the books and scrolls out of the Chaos Scar, or defend The Head in the Clouds from other curious Scar denizens. Either way, the characters must find new elementals and then reclaim the head from those who have it when they return—surely that’s a quest worthy of the reward of a flying fortress!
