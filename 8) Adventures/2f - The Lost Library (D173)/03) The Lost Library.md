Setup Warded desk trap 

The PCs continue down a recently excavated passage and discover a well-crafted room carved out of the bedrock. Piles of rock lie by the entry to the cavern where the kobolds broke into the chamber. 

When the PCs enter the room, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> As you turn the corner, the natural walls of the passage abruptly transition into well-crafted stonework. A rock wall that sealed off the tunnel has been pushed down and now lies scattered on the floor, allowing access to a chamber illuminated by a soft blue glow. 
> 
> Two ransacked bookshelves lean against the walls of the room. The contents of the shelves have been thrown into a moldering pile on the floor. 
> 
> An antique desk sits near the middle of the room, surrounded by glowing dwarven runes carved into the floor. Behind the desk is a wooden table covered in alchemical equipment. In the far corner of the room, a humming arcane portal hovers a few inches above a glowing circle carved into the floor. 
> 
> As a small clutch of kobolds turn to face you, a dragonborn clad in leather armor unsheathes a longsword and nimbly advances, snarling. 

### Tactics 
Gravash is overconfident and does not see the PCs as a threat. He takes tactically poor decisions to show off his training: He won’t concentrate on one foe, but instead leap over one foe with end-over-end strike, and then follow up with a longsword attack against a different target. 

The dark talon kobold reluctantly joins Gravash in combat, moving into a flanking position when possible. The kobold slingers attack the PCs from behind the warded desk, using it to gain cover against the characters. The miners cower in the hallway, only emerging if they can strike at an opponent without provoking an opportunity attack. Gravash and the kobolds all know about the trapped desk and won’t willingly trigger it.

### Features of the Area 
**Illumination:** The glowing runes around the desk and magic circle illuminate the room with dim light. 

**Collapsed Wall:** The wall the kobolds broke through lies in pieces on the floor and now counts as difficult terrain. 

**Pile of Books:** The books are in very poor condition due to centuries of abuse by the elements, but with some study it can be determined that these books deal with esoteric arcane knowledge, such as the creation of magical items or the history of the Elemental Chaos. This is a good opportunity to introduce alchemical formulas or ritual books if desired for your campaign. 

If hired to recover Emeranith’s stolen books, they are found here. The books include information about the history of the local lands, especially the period before the meteor hit. 

**Desk:** The desk contains [[voran's-eternal-chalk|Voran's Eternal Chalk]], *Formula - 5 Talisman (Dupe's Gold Nugget)*, [[fearcracker-tv|Fearcracker]] and a few scraps of paper written in a goliath dialect of Dwarven. The paper is yellowed with age, but some writing can be deciphered, including a fragment from a journal: 

	It is fitting that the lantern’s elemental flame grants access to my library; only the knowledge in these books has granted me the power to tame the elements. My mastery over earth and stone continues to grow. I excavated the Tomb in record time and the portal opens perfectly when I blow the whistle. 
	
	I wish I did not need a tomb, but I’ve chased off too many grave robbers over the past few months. I could not risk Locantra’s body being stolen. I moved entire blocks of earth at once, but they are now safe deep underground—the dead shall lie in peace. 
	
	I have only one chamber left to build, but it will be the most difficult of all. I am almost finished with the key—just one final enchantment and the battle standard will be complete. 

**Caved-In Passage:** The short passage collapsed when the meteor struck, isolating the library from outside. Clearing out the tunnel would be as much work as digging a new tunnel. The end of the passage counts as difficult terrain. 

**Alchemical Bench:** Most of the ingredients on the bench are dried up and useless. PCs searching the desk are able to salvage two *Acid Flasks (Moderate)* and various alchemical reagents. 

**Portal:** The portal in the corner leads to the final room in this portion of Voran’s library, and [[04) The Inner Sanctum]]
