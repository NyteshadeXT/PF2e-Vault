This encounter establishes the kobold tribe, Kethendtir’s home, and the entry to the cavern. 

Setup 2 kobold dragonshields (D) 5 kobold miners (M) 1 kobold slinger (S) Kethendtir, brown dragon wyrmling (K) Collapsing rock pile (T) 

Kethendtir doesn’t enter the battle until the start of the third round of combat. 

Two kobold dragonshields stand watch at the mouth of the first chamber. Any character that moves into the cavern must succeed at a DC 12 Stealth check (to beat the kobolds’ passive Perception) or alert the kobolds. 

If the characters that enter the cave succeed, the kobolds are surprised. If a hero succeeds at a DC 21 Perception check within 3 squares of where the wyrmling has burrowed into the sand, read the following: The ground at the cave mouth is disturbed, as if something has recently been buried below the sand. When Kethendtir enters the combat, roll initiative, place him at the cavern entry where indicated on the map, and read or paraphrase the following: Sand scatters as a brown dragon the size of a small dog launches itself out of the ground. Bellowing, the dragon says, “A swift death comes to those that interfere with the creation of my home.” Collapsing Rock Pile Single-Use Terrain A precariously stacked pile of rocks is ready to fall with a single strong push. Standard Action Requirement: You must be adjacent to the rock pile. Check: Athletics check (DC 15) to collapse the rock pile. Success: The pile of rocks falls, crushing nearby creatures. Target: Each creature in a close blast 3 next to the rock pile. Attack: +5 vs. Fortitude Hit: 2d8 + 1 damage, and the target is knocked prone. Effect: The area where the rocks fall becomes difficult terrain. Tactics The kobold dragonshields hold their ground while the kobold slinger fires at the PCs from a distance. Any PC with a passive Insight 12 or greater can tell that the dragonshields are surprisingly brave—they know that the wyrmling will soon come to their rescue. The miners avoid combat, but if a target move near the rock pile trap, a miner attempts to push the rock pile on to the PCs. With an Athletics check of –1, it is likely the miner will fail the attempt—describe what the kobold is doing to give the characters the chance to do the same thing in return. If the battle turns sour, some of the kobold miners flee by either moving deeper into the cavern or by leaping into the hole in the floor. If a character moves next to a fleeing miner, the miner shifts away as a minor action on its turn and flees. If any kobolds escape through the tunnel (which is likely), the PCs cannot gain surprise in any encounter for the rest of the adventure unless they take an extended rest.

Kethendtir has the arrogance of youth, and at the beginning of the combat he believes he is assured of victory. When he leaps out of the ground, the wyrmling engulf the party with his breath weapon and follows up with a sand cloud attack. If none of the characters are blinded, he tries to use his kobold allies and flanking partners as he resorts to melee attacks. Once his hit points have been reduced to 15 or below, he burrows through the sand and flees into the cave, attempting to get help from his dragonborn allies.

Features of the Area Illumination: Hesskin has commanded the kobolds to illuminate the entire cavern because he has no natural ability to see in the dark. Several torches are crudely bolted to the walls throughout the chamber, providing bright light. Rock Piles: The kobold’s mining operations has resulted in many rock piles throughout the cavern. These piles of stone are difficult terrain. One rock pile is precariously stacked and might fall with some encouragement. The location of this single-use terrain is marked on the map (T). Sinkhole: In the middle of the room is a sinkhole that leads to a network of tunnels below the ground. Small creatures can squeeze through the tunnels, and creatures that are Tiny or smaller have no movement penalties. A multitude of tunnels grant fleeing kobolds many opportunities to hide, but an energetic halfling or gnome could attempt to track the miners down. For each kobold that escaped down the hole that an adventurer chases, have that character attempt a DC 10 Dungeoneering check to determine if they can catch up to a miner. Success indicates the character finds a kobold and combat ensues; if the character fails, he or she manages to find a kobold as well, but loses a healing surge during the hunt. Each attempt takes 10 minutes.
