This encounter establishes the kobold tribe, Kethendtir’s home, and the entry to the cavern. 

Setup Collapsing rock pile (T) 

Kethendtir doesn’t enter the battle until the start of the third round of combat. 

Two kobold dragonshields stand watch at the mouth of the first chamber. Any character that moves into the cavern must succeed at a DC 12 Stealth check (to beat the kobolds’ passive Perception) or alert the kobolds. If the characters that enter the cave succeed, the kobolds are surprised. 

If a hero succeeds at a DC 21 [[skills#Perception|Perception]] check within 3 squares of where the wyrmling has burrowed into the sand, read the following: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The ground at the cave mouth is disturbed, as if something has recently been buried below the sand. 

When Kethendtir enters the combat, roll initiative, place him at the cavern entry where indicated on the map, and read or paraphrase the following: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Sand scatters as a dragon launches itself out of the ground. Bellowing, the dragon says, “A swift death comes to those that interfere with the creation of my home.” 

### Tactics 
The dark talon kobolds hold their ground while the kobold slinger fires at the PCs from a distance. Any PC with a passive [[skills#Perception|Perception]] of 14 or greater can tell that the dark talons are surprisingly brave—they know that the wyrmling will soon come to their rescue.  The miners avoid combat.

If the battle turns sour, some of the kobold miners flee by either moving deeper into the cavern or by leaping into the hole in the floor. If a character moves next to a fleeing miner, the miner turns and flees on it's turn. If any kobolds escape through the tunnel (which is likely), the PCs cannot gain surprise in any encounter for the rest of the adventure unless they take a long rest.

Kethendtir has the arrogance of youth, and at the beginning of the combat he believes he is assured of victory. When he leaps out of the ground, the wyrmling scorches the party with his breath weapon and follows up with a coiling frenzy attack. If none of the characters are grabbed, he tries to use his kobold allies and flanking partners as he resorts to melee attacks. Once his hit points have been reduced to 15 or below, he burrows through the sand and flees into the cave, attempting to get help from his allies.

### Features of the Area
**Illumination:** Hesskin has commanded the kobolds to illuminate the entire cavern because he has no natural ability to see in the dark. Several torches are crudely bolted to the walls throughout the chamber, providing bright light. 

**Rock Piles:** The kobold’s mining operations has resulted in many rock piles throughout the cavern. These piles of stone are difficult terrain. 

**Sinkhole:** In the middle of the room is a sinkhole that leads to a network of tunnels below the ground. Small creatures can squeeze through the tunnels, and creatures that are Tiny or smaller have no movement penalties. A multitude of tunnels grant fleeing kobolds many opportunities to hide, but an energetic halfling or gnome could attempt to track the miners down. For each kobold that escaped down the hole that an adventurer chases, have that character attempt a DC 10 [[skills#Survival|Survival]] check to determine if they can catch up to a miner. Success indicates the character finds a kobold and combat ensues; if the character fails, he or she is unable to find a kobold. Each attempt takes 10 minutes.
