This is Voran’s inner sanctum, the heart of his distributed laboratories buried deep underground. Hesskin and Nibbik only recently started exploring this chamber when the PCs interrupt them. 

When the PCs enter this room, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> As you step through the portal, you feel your bodies shifted through miles of rock in a moment that feels both instantaneous and endless. You feel your form coalesce in a rocky chamber standing in a glowing yellow circle. A hovering lantern stands a short distance away, illuminating the room. Before you is a wooden staircase leading up to the rest of the room. At the top of the stairs stands a dragonborn clad in scale next to a amalgamation of putrefied parts stitched together to form some kind of abomination.

If any of the kobolds escaped from [[02) The Wyrmling's Cave]] and the party hasn’t taken a long rest, Hesskin immediately fires a crossbow bolt at the first character that comes out of the portal, beginning combat. 

[[skills#perception|Perception]] DC 17: The character spots the rest of the kobolds. If the adventurers are unaware of the kobolds, the creatures have surprise when they make their first attack. 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Three kobolds skirt the perimeter of the room, getting ready to attack! 

### Tactics 
Hesskin prefers to start the combat by firing his crossbow from the top of the stairs, defending the supporting the carrion golom. Hesskin is patient—he won’t rush into melee until the kobold slingers, the carrion golom, or Nibbik are overwhelmed. The carrion golom guard area is the 4-square by 4-square magic circle in the middle of the room attacking only PCs in that area. 

The kobold slingers look for casters to minimize their overall effectiveness.  

Nibbik is a coward and tries to keep Hesskin between himself and the PCs. Nibbik uses incite faith early in the encounter to protect his slingers. Once Hesskin is defeated, Nibbik surrenders. He prefers to surrender to a kobold PC if possible, pledging himself and the remaining kobolds to do the heroes’ will.

### Features of the Area
**Illumination:** The floating lantern [[voran's-eternal-lantern|Voren's Eternal Lantern]] (L on the map) provides bright light to all squares on the lower platform and the stairs, but the rest of the chamber is dim light. 

**Lower Platform:** The 8-square by 8-square platform with the magic circle is 2 squares below the rest of the room. The walls are difficult ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] DC 22) to climb.

**Stairs:** The stairs count as difficult terrain. 

**Portal Circle:** This circle is a link to all of Voran’s chambers. While [[voran's-eternal-lantern|Voren's Eternal Lantern]] illuminates the circle, the portal to the library remains open. If a character that searches the circle succeeds at a DC 17 [[skills#Perception|Perception]] check, they notice the ground around the circle is covered with a fine red chalk dust. Once the lantern no longer illuminates the circle, the portal closes. 

If another one of Voran’s item keys is used by the circle, a portal opens allowing access to another chamber.  [[voran's-eternal-lantern|Voren's Eternal Lantern]] creates the link to the library. If [[voran's-eternal-chalk|Voran's Eternal Chalk]] is used to draw a red line in the circle, a portal is opened to Voran’s study, in the adventure “Stick in the Mud”. The portal remains open until the party takes an long rest. 

**Hatch:** The hatch requires a DC 22 [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] check to open. Below the hatch is a set of circular stairs that lead to a small living area that provides enough room for the characters to take a long rest. The hatch can be bolted from within. The living area is enchanted, providing individual resting chambers for up to ten creatures. The name of each of the PCs is written on one of these doors. Items left in the chamber will be there when the owner returns.

## Concluding the Adventure
If the characters decide to spare Nibbik, you have the option of introducing kobolds as companion characters to the party. 

Three potential kobolds can join the group, depending on what the party needs. Nibbik, Kobold DragonMage; Minnock, Kobold Scout; Krunk One-Ear, Dark Talon Kobold. These kobolds are all members of the Fireclaw tribe. 

Nibbik is an opportunist—he sees potential in the characters. His loyalty is not absolute, and if the PCs ever face an opponent that seems able to defeat them, Nibbik will switch sides to save his own hide. He also seeks the power that a shard of the meteor would grant him—should he find one, he will attempt to seize it without a second thought. 

The PCs might choose to use Voran’s sanctum as a base of operations in the valley. No map is provided for the space below the Portal chamber, but the space should have the basic necessities for resting. If the players start using this area as a base of operations, they might be interested in outfitting the base with wondrous lair items as described on page 79 of Adventurer’s Vault 2.
