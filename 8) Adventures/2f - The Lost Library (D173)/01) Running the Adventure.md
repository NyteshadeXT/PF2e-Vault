**Total Adventure Value:** 265 xp

The adventurers make their way to the lair of the brown dragon wyrmling Kethendtir. There, they must face the dragon almost as soon as they arrive, along with a number of kobold miners serving of the dragon. Afterward, the characters can make their way deeper into the complex, eventually finding the site of the kobolds’ excavation. They must face Gravash and Hesskin, the two dwarves who initially forced these kobold outcasts into service, along with some hostile defenses Voran left to ward his library. The characters have an opportunity to negotiate with the kobolds through Nibbik, their wyrmpriest, and make an alliance with the kobolds to provide them with intelligence on future explorations of the Chaos Scar. 

# Adventure Hooks
**Stolen Gear** 
Thorgrim Spinehammer is a dwarf in charge of a small mine close to the Chaos Scar. He recently suffered the theft of his mining equipment and tracked the thieves as far as the King’s Wall. Not willing to risk his own life by entering the valley, he offers to pay the characters 75 gp to follow the kobolds to the cave and recover twelve stolen picks. Thorgrim will pay as much as 125 gp to avoid purchasing replacement gear, but a DC 15 Diplomacy check must be made to convince the miserly dwarf to part with his money. 

**Wyrmling Raider** 
Local farmers have been losing livestock to raids performed by a brown wyrmling dragon (Kethendtir). The farmers know that this problem will only get worse in the future, so they have banded together to solve their problem. A quiet halfling farmer named Karrie Buttonquail approaches the characters with all the money the farmers could amass: 2,618 cp. If the PCs try to bargain, she’ll reluctantly throw in her prize sheep worth 100 sp. 

Once the characters get to the cavern, read or paraphrase the following description of the wyrmling’s cave entry: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Small reptilian tracks disturb the fine sand that spills out of the secluded cave before you. A nearby pile of sharp, jagged rocks has been haphazardly piled outside of the cave. 

When the characters enter the cave, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The grass grows sparse as you approach the cave, revealing a sand-covered stone floor. A well-trodden trail leads into the darkness. The sound of metal on rock reverberates throughout the cavern. 

Characters examining the tracks outside of the cavern can make a [[skills#Perception|Perception]] Check: 
	**DC 15 Perception:** The characters find multiple kobold tracks, a couple of larger reptilian prints as wide as a dragonborn’s foot, and small tracks that appear to belong to either a drake or dragon.
