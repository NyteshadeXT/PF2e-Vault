# Adventure Synopsis
The “abandoned” tunnels beneath Stormcrow Tor comprise the quintessential small dungeon. Stories of the treasures hoarded up by the missing trio and their entourage have only grown in the telling. Heroes who hearken to these tales or are otherwise lured to the site find a collection of interesting encounters, and they learn what really happened to the original three adventurers. If they manage to press through all the way to the end, they even discover that one of the missing adventurers, Agera of the Shadow Face, yet remains beneath the Tor, though in a terrible state much changed from her original form. With perseverance, the PCs can liberate all the treasures that remain in the dungeon, though perhaps they should think twice about claiming the artifact that precipitated Stormcrow Company’s destruction.

## The Real Story 
What no one outside Stormcrow Tor currently knows is that the adventuring group wasn’t silenced by an external threat but by internal strife. In the end, an artifact pulled from the devastation of a ruined lich’s tower (the Wrathstone) drove Stormcrow Company to madness. Tempers and paranoia ran riot. Before all-out internecine rivalry exterminated Stormcrow Company, each principle fortified his or her portion of the shared base, gathered secret allies, and tried to snare former friends in traps, catch them with curses, or kill them through simple force of arms. 

A final paroxysm of rage and murder swept through the torchlit tunnels beneath Stormcrow Tor. When it was over, two of the three principles were dead and one was altered beyond all recognition. 

In the years since, the old base has been partly colonized by Tengu and myconids; even these opportunistic monsters, however, know to stay clear of the deepest chambers. Though great treasures surely reside there, so do the most insidious traps left behind by maddened mercenaries whose sanity was well and truly shredded long before their bodies followed. Things still move in the deeps, and not all of those things are living

# Adventure Hooks
**Retake the Tower (Job Board):** [[Lord Drysdale]] requests aid retaking Stormcrow Tor. A reward of 50 gold is offered to any group that is successful. See [[Elessan]] for further details.

**Artifact Retrieval:** [[Balewin]] reaches out to Varas with a request to retrieve a powerful artifact called Wrathheart which he believes is still under Stormcrow Tor. The Guild has authorized him to pay up to 100 gold. 

**Vanished (Restwell Rumors):** The player characters hear about a location called Stormcrow Tor, which served as the base for a group of vanished adventurers. PCs interested in learning more can attempt the skill checks presented below. Discovering the tor’s location in the wilderness is as easy as another DC 20 [[skills#Survival|Survival]] check.

If players decide to investigate the tor, they can learn the following information with a successful [[skills#Society|Society]] or [[gather-information|Gather Information]] check: 
- **DC 7:** Illugi Swordbreaker, the Emerald Witch, and Agera of the Shadow Face led a mercenary group called Stormcrow Company. Each had a storied adventuring background before they joined their strengths, but those stories are as nothing compared to the tales of the exploits of Stormcrow Company. The mercenaries made their base in old tunnels they found beneath a rocky tor in the wilderness. 
- **DC 12:** Though Stormcrow Company was credited with cleaning the goblin tribes out of the Scar and killing a lich who once threatened Restwell Keep from its dark tower, the adventurers also accepted contracts to assassinate nobles in a neighboring Wellspring, kidnapped an elven princess in return for a ransom of questionable relics, and even burned down an entire village on a lark while passing through. In the end, they were feared more than revered. 
- **DC 17:** Ten full years have passed since any member of Stormcrow Company has been seen, and that sighting (of Illugi Swordbreaker taking ship in Arcglen, an eastern port) is probably only rumor. Each year that passes with no news from Stormcrow Tor is a year that nearby keeps and walled villages give thanks. Anyone with an opinion on the topic now believes Stormcrow Company took on a challenge it was unequal to and came to a bad end in some far off land or echo dimension. 

# Running the Adventure
Stormcrow Tor is at least a few days’ travel from the closest keep or walled village. Vicious humanoids and other random dangers may lurk in the surrounding wilderness, at your discretion.

When the heroes arrive, refer to the Stormcrow Tor overview map on the following page, and Encounter 1: Entering the Tor.

# Encounter T1: Entering The Tor
**Encounter Difficulty:** Moderate (95 xp)

![[SCT E1 Map.webp]]

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 5: [[tengu-tribal|Tengu Tribal]] T
 - 1: [[tengu-inciter|Tengu Inciter]] I
 - 1: [[tengu-wing-mage|Tengu Wing Mage]]
 - 1: [[necrotic-gelatinous-cube|Necrotic Gelatinous Cube]]

```encounter
name: Entering the Tor
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 5: [[Tengu Tribal]] 
- 1: [[Tengu Inciter]]
- 1: [[Tengu Wind Mage]]
- 1: [[Necrotic Gelatinous Cube]]
```

When the PCs first see the tor, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A weathered pile of stones and packed earth protrudes from the ground like a giant’s rampart. The battered shell of a ruined tower leans from the tor’s apex. The tower is roofless and hollow.

Climbing the tor requires a DC 21 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check. Treat the entire tor, save for the 30-foot-diameter hollow tower interior, as difficult terrain. A crudely constructed wooden hatch door is only loosely covered by strewn leaves and dirt. The hatch opens onto an ancient stone circular stairwell that plunges down into the tor’s heart.

If PCs descend into room 1’s west end, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A 20-foot-wide hall leads east. Dirt and black feathers are strewn everywhere. At the far end, a barricade of tumbled stone stands before splintered and broken iron double doors. Two hooded heads poke over the barricade, watching the approach.

Ravenlike humanoids called Tengu have claimed a portion of Stormcrow Company’s old base for themselves.

A pair of Tengu tribals guards the western portico of this chamber, behind a barricade (granting them both concealment from ranged attacks from the west).

If the 2 Tengu hear invaders on the stairs, they use their mimicry ability while ducked down behind the barricade, making their voices sound just like one of the heroes (if they heard them talking) or a small child calling for help. The Tengu attempt to draw the heroes forward, into the main chamber of room 1.

If combat breaks out, each Tengu tribal throws 1 javelin, then retreats into the main chamber of room 1. The overall strategy of the Tengu is to draw heroes into the main room, where heroes are more likely to fall into the clutches of either the mobile gelatinous cube or the one stuck at the bottom of the central pit.

If PCs see into the main room, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> An empty stone niche looks across the room’s surprisingly dirt-free expanse, over an uncovered pit, to a shrine on the east wall that glimmers dimly. The words Stormcrow Company are scratched in the wall above the shrine. Dark
forms scamper about the chamber.

## Tactics
As described above, the Tengu first try to lure heroes into the main room so that they can draw characters into or near the stone niche containing the mobile gelatinous cube or push characters into the pit that contains a gelatinous cube at its bottom. 

The Tengu tribals rely on their ranged javelins and resort to melee only if forced into it. The tribals remain clear of the 10-foot-wide unmarked space between the niche containing the gelatinous cube and the open pit.

The Tengu inciter uses its chain slide ability to slide heroes either into the pit or toward the niche containing the gelatinous cube, whichever is close.

The Tengu wing mage uses its hurricane blast to slide heroes toward the same doom as the inciter, whenever that power is available.

The mobile gelatinous cube doesn’t enter combat until a hero is within 3 squares (allowing it to slide forward 3 and attack). The gelatinous cubes attack all creatures indiscriminately, so the Tengu are sure to stay away from them.

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** Dark. The Tengu can see in the dark; the PCs must provide their own light source.

**“Empty” Niche:** The stone nook containing a gelatinous cube appears empty (DC 28 [[skills#perception|Perception]] check to notice otherwise). Every so often the cube slides forth and “cleans” the chamber of loose feathers and dirt, during which times the Tengu make themselves absent.

**Pit:** The bottom 10 feet of this 30-foot-deep pit contains another gelatinous cube, but this one can’t move or attack. Any creature that falls in is automatically engulfed. Creatures that escape the engulfing grab must immediately succeed at a DC 25 [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] check to maintain a hold on the side of the rough wall (DC 17 if someone lowers a rope) or fall back into the body of the cube. It can be detected only if characters examine the pit specifically (or someone falls in, of course); a cursory search of the chamber won’t reveal it.

**Shrine:** The shrine (and the rest of the chamber) once contained trophies of Stormcrow Company’s adventuring successes. The few valuable ones were looted and the rest destroyed years ago.


# Encounte  T2: Fungal Cellar
**Encounter Difficulty:** difficulty (xxx xp)

![[SCT E2 Map.webp]]

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 2: [[BadGuy1]] W
 - 2: [[BadGuy2]] H

```encounter
name: EncounterName
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 2: [[Badguy1]] 
- 2: [[Badguy2]]
```

Setup
2 myconid guards (G)
1 myconid rotpriest (R)
1 myconid sovereign (S)
1 fungal bloodthorn (B)

The narrow stairs that lead from area 1 to area 2 reveal something of the current tenants.

When PCs look down the stairs toward the door to area 2, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The air in the stairwell is damp and smells of forest rot. The steep stairs descend 20 feet and end at a door. The door is covered in an uneven layer of slightly phosphorescent fungus.

This was once Stormcrow Company’s cellar, where they stored a fabulous assortment of food, wine, ale, and rare spirits. With the mercenaries’ absence, however, the natural, cool damp in the chamber allowed spores from a foray into the Feywild to germinate and spread without interference.

A tiny colony of myconids now infests the chamber. The tengu have launched several sorties into the chamber, so the myconids have prepared themselves to eliminate any nonfungal creature that attempts to enter through the northern doorway.

The myconids in the chamber do not immediately attack unless they are attacked. The myconid sovereign stands unmoving like a natural fungus stalk on the far wall, and the other myconids are resting in one of the side chambers. Unless the PCs see the myconid sovereign for what it is and attack, the encounter begins when one or more PCs come adjacent to the pool. At that point, the fungal bloodthorn squatting beneath the surface launches a surprise attack.

When PCs look into this chamber, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Bioluminescent fungi coat the walls and ceiling of this cool, moist chamber, and tiny mushrooms and other fungal stalks carpet the floor and the detritus of barrels, crates, and shelves littering the chamber’s corners. Slimy water pools in the chamber’s center. The pool is bracketed by four piles of humanoid skulls. A particularly large fungus stalk grows up the far wall.
> 
> [[skills#perception|Perception]] Check DC 24 The particularly large mushroom growing up the opposite wall has eyes!

## Tactics
The fight likely starts when the fungal bloodthorn surfaces from beneath the pool (appearing as a mass of fungal vines) and attempts to use striking vine or impaling thorn; it may do so as a surprise action. If it can use the latter, it pulls its victim into the water. The water is only waist-deep, which means Medium creatures (other than the bloodthorn) treat it as difficult terrain.

The myconids in the side chambers rush to join the fight as soon as they are able. The rotpriest positions itself near the myconid guards, absorbing their damage with roots of the colony and sacrifice for the colony and then regenerating. It uses decomposing spray when it can hit multiple targets. Otherwise, it uses its stipe staff to bludgeon enemies.

The myconid sovereign remains behind its allies, relying on them for protection. It uses commanding spores to make certain its allies continue to protect it. It uses spore burst even when enemies are engaged in melee with its allies (since they’re all plants, they are immune to the effect).

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** Dim. The bioluminescent fungi on the wall provides a candlelike glow to the main chamber of this area.

**Central Pool:** The water in the pool is about three and a half feet deep, serving as difficult terrain for Medium creatures. Small creatures must swim. The water in the pool is tinged with virulent spores that act like a poison—any nonplant that enters or starts its turn in the water gains ongoing poison 1 (save ends).

**Skull Piles:** Simple trophies. Among the recent tengu heads are very old goblin and human skulls. A skull pile is high enough to provide concealment against ranged attacks.

**Corner Detritus:** Though not thick enough to serve as difficult terrain, the remains of barrels, crates, kegs, and other storage vessels swept into the corners of this chamber make it easy to determine that the chamber was once a cellar for storing food and spirits.

**Side Caves:** These areas are cooler than the main area, and the myconids spend much of their time there in spore-induced communion with each other and the lesser plants.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> Treasure: A small, rusted iron chest is lodged in the wall of the western cave. The chest is locked (DC 18 Thievery check to open). The well-padded interior holds one parcel of treasure.
