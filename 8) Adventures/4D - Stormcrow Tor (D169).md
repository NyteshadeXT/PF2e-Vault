# Adventure Synopsis
The “abandoned” tunnels beneath Stormcrow Tor comprise the quintessential small dungeon. Stories of the treasures hoarded up by the missing trio and their entourage have only grown in the telling. Heroes who hearken to these tales or are otherwise lured to the site find a collection of interesting encounters, and they learn what really happened to the original three adventurers. If they manage to press through all the way to the end, they even discover that one of the missing adventurers, Agera of the Shadow Face, yet remains beneath the Tor, though in a terrible state much changed from her original form. With perseverance, the PCs can liberate all the treasures that remain in the dungeon, though perhaps they should think twice about claiming the artifact that precipitated Stormcrow Company’s destruction.

## The Real Story 
What no one outside Stormcrow Tor currently knows is that the adventuring group wasn’t silenced by an external threat but by internal strife. In the end, an artifact pulled from the devastation of a ruined lich’s tower (the Wrathstone) drove Stormcrow Company to madness. Tempers and paranoia ran riot. Before all-out internecine rivalry exterminated Stormcrow Company, each principle fortified his or her portion of the shared base, gathered secret allies, and tried to snare former friends in traps, catch them with curses, or kill them through simple force of arms. 

A final paroxysm of rage and murder swept through the torchlit tunnels beneath Stormcrow Tor. When it was over, two of the three principles were dead and one was altered beyond all recognition. 

In the years since, the old base has been partly colonized by Tengu and myconids; even these opportunistic monsters, however, know to stay clear of the deepest chambers. Though great treasures surely reside there, so do the most insidious traps left behind by maddened mercenaries whose sanity was well and truly shredded long before their bodies followed. Things still move in the deeps, and not all of those things are living

# Adventure Hooks
**Retake the Tower (Job Board):** [[Lord Drysdale]] requests aid retaking Stormcrow Tor. A reward of 50 gold is offered to any group that is successful. See [[Elessan]] for further details.

**Artifact Retrieval:** [[Balewin]] reaches out to Varas with a request to retrieve a powerful artifact called Wrathheart which he believes is still under Stormcrow Tor. The Guild has authorized him to pay up to 100 gold. 

**Vanished (Restwell Rumors):** The player characters hear about a location called Stormcrow Tor, which served as the base for a group of vanished adventurers. PCs interested in learning more can attempt the skill checks presented below. Discovering the tor’s location in the wilderness is as easy as another DC 20 [[skills#Survival|Survival]] check.

If players decide to investigate the tor, they can learn the following information with a successful [[skills#Society|Society]] or [[gather-information|Gather Information]] check: 
- **DC 7:** Illugi Swordbreaker, the Emerald Witch, and Agera of the Shadow Face led a mercenary group called Stormcrow Company. Each had a storied adventuring background before they joined their strengths, but those stories are as nothing compared to the tales of the exploits of Stormcrow Company. The mercenaries made their base in old tunnels they found beneath a rocky tor in the wilderness. 
- **DC 12:** Though Stormcrow Company was credited with cleaning the goblin tribes out of the Scar and killing a lich who once threatened Restwell Keep from its dark tower, the adventurers also accepted contracts to assassinate nobles in a neighboring Wellspring, kidnapped an elven princess in return for a ransom of questionable relics, and even burned down an entire village on a lark while passing through. In the end, they were feared more than revered. 
- **DC 17:** Ten full years have passed since any member of Stormcrow Company has been seen, and that sighting (of Illugi Swordbreaker taking ship in Arcglen, an eastern port) is probably only rumor. Each year that passes with no news from Stormcrow Tor is a year that nearby keeps and walled villages give thanks. Anyone with an opinion on the topic now believes Stormcrow Company took on a challenge it was unequal to and came to a bad end in some far off land or echo dimension. 

# Running the Adventure
Stormcrow Tor is at least a few days’ travel from the closest keep or walled village. Vicious humanoids and other random dangers may lurk in the surrounding wilderness, at your discretion.

When the heroes arrive, refer to the Stormcrow Tor overview map on the following page, and Encounter 1: Entering the Tor.

# Encounter T1: Entering The Tor
**Encounter Difficulty:** Moderate (95 xp)

![[SCT E1 Map.webp]]

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 5: [[tengu-tribal|Tengu Tribal]] T
 - 1: [[tengu-inciter|Tengu Inciter]] I
 - 1: [[tengu-wing-mage|Tengu Wing Mage]]
 - 1: [[necrotic-gelatinous-cube|Necrotic Gelatinous Cube]]

```encounter
name: Entering the Tor
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 5: [[Tengu Tribal]] 
- 1: [[Tengu Inciter]]
- 1: [[Tengu Wing Mage]]
- 1: [[Necrotic Gelatinous Cube]]
```

When the PCs first see the tor, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A weathered pile of stones and packed earth protrudes from the ground like a giant’s rampart. The battered shell of a ruined tower leans from the tor’s apex. The tower is roofless and hollow.

Climbing the tor requires a DC 21 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check. Treat the entire tor, save for the 30-foot-diameter hollow tower interior, as difficult terrain. A crudely constructed wooden hatch door is only loosely covered by strewn leaves and dirt. The hatch opens onto an ancient stone circular stairwell that plunges down into the tor’s heart.

If PCs descend into room 1’s west end, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A 20-foot-wide hall leads east. Dirt and black feathers are strewn everywhere. At the far end, a barricade of tumbled stone stands before splintered and broken iron double doors. Two hooded heads poke over the barricade, watching the approach.

Ravenlike humanoids called Tengu have claimed a portion of Stormcrow Company’s old base for themselves.

A pair of Tengu tribals guards the western portico of this chamber, behind a barricade (granting them both concealment from ranged attacks from the west).

If the 2 Tengu hear invaders on the stairs, they use their mimicry ability while ducked down behind the barricade, making their voices sound just like one of the heroes (if they heard them talking) or a small child calling for help. The Tengu attempt to draw the heroes forward, into the main chamber of room 1.

If combat breaks out, each Tengu tribal throws 1 javelin, then retreats into the main chamber of room 1. The overall strategy of the Tengu is to draw heroes into the main room, where heroes are more likely to fall into the clutches of either the mobile gelatinous cube or the one stuck at the bottom of the central pit.

If PCs see into the main room, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> An empty stone niche looks across the room’s surprisingly dirt-free expanse, over an uncovered pit, to a shrine on the east wall that glimmers dimly. The words Stormcrow Company are scratched in the wall above the shrine. Dark
forms scamper about the chamber.

## Tactics
As described above, the Tengu first try to lure heroes into the main room so that they can draw characters into or near the stone niche containing the mobile gelatinous cube or push characters into the pit that contains a gelatinous cube at its bottom. 

The Tengu tribals rely on their ranged javelins and resort to melee only if forced into it. The tribals remain clear of the 10-foot-wide unmarked space between the niche containing the gelatinous cube and the open pit.

The Tengu inciter uses its chain slide ability to slide heroes either into the pit or toward the niche containing the gelatinous cube, whichever is close.

The Tengu wing mage uses its hurricane blast to slide heroes toward the same doom as the inciter, whenever that power is available.

The mobile gelatinous cube doesn’t enter combat until a hero is within 3 squares (allowing it to slide forward 3 and attack). The gelatinous cubes attack all creatures indiscriminately, so the Tengu are sure to stay away from them.

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** Dark. The Tengu can see in the dark; the PCs must provide their own light source.

**“Empty” Niche:** The stone nook containing a gelatinous cube appears empty (DC 28 [[skills#perception|Perception]] check to notice otherwise). Every so often the cube slides forth and “cleans” the chamber of loose feathers and dirt, during which times the Tengu make themselves absent.

**Pit:** The bottom 10 feet of this 30-foot-deep pit contains another gelatinous cube, but this one can’t move or attack. Any creature that falls in is automatically engulfed. Creatures that escape the engulfing grab must immediately succeed at a DC 25 [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] check to maintain a hold on the side of the rough wall (DC 17 if someone lowers a rope) or fall back into the body of the cube. It can be detected only if characters examine the pit specifically (or someone falls in, of course); a cursory search of the chamber won’t reveal it.

**Shrine:** The shrine (and the rest of the chamber) once contained trophies of Stormcrow Company’s adventuring successes. The few valuable ones were looted and the rest destroyed years ago.


# Encounter  T2: Fungal Cellar
**Encounter Difficulty:** Moderate (85 xp)

![[SCT E2 Map.webp]]

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 2: [[myconid-guard|Myconid Guard]] G
 - 1: [[myconid-rotpriest|Myconid Rotpriest]] R
 - 1: [[myconid-sovereign|Myconid Sovereign]] S
 - 1: [[tendriculos|Tendriculos]] B

```encounter
name: Fungal Cellar
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 2: [[Myconid Guard]] 
- 1: [[Myconid Rotpriest]]
- 1: [[Myconid Sovereign]]
- 1: [[Tendriculos]]
```

The narrow stairs that lead from area 1 to area 2 reveal something of the current tenants.

When PCs look down the stairs toward the door to area 2, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The air in the stairwell is damp and smells of forest rot. The steep stairs descend 20 feet and end at a door. The door is covered in an uneven layer of slightly phosphorescent fungus.

This was once Stormcrow Company’s cellar, where they stored a fabulous assortment of food, wine, ale, and rare spirits. With the mercenaries’ absence, however, the natural, cool damp in the chamber allowed spores from a foray into the Feywild to germinate and spread without interference.

A tiny colony of myconids now infests the chamber. The tengu have launched several sorties into the chamber, so the myconids have prepared themselves to eliminate any nonfungal creature that attempts to enter through the northern doorway.

The myconids in the chamber do not immediately attack unless they are attacked. The myconid sovereign stands unmoving like a natural fungus stalk on the far wall, and the other myconids are resting in one of the side chambers. Unless the PCs see the myconid sovereign for what it is and attack, the encounter begins when one or more PCs come adjacent to the pool. At that point, the tendriculos squatting beneath the surface launches a surprise attack.

When PCs look into this chamber, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Bioluminescent fungi coat the walls and ceiling of this cool, moist chamber, and tiny mushrooms and other fungal stalks carpet the floor and the detritus of barrels, crates, and shelves littering the chamber’s corners. Slimy water pools in the chamber’s center. The pool is bracketed by four piles of humanoid skulls. A particularly large fungus stalk grows up the far wall.
> 
> [[skills#perception|Perception]] Check DC 24 The particularly large mushroom growing up the opposite wall has eyes!

## Tactics
The fight likely starts when the tendriculos surfaces from beneath the pool (appearing as a mass of fungal vines) and attempts to use bite and swallow whole; it may do so as a surprise action. If it can use the latter, it pulls its victim into the water. The water is only waist-deep, which means Medium creatures (other than the tendriculos) treat it as difficult terrain.

The myconids in the side chambers rush to join the fight as soon as they are able. The rotpriest positions itself near the myconid guards, absorbing their damage with sacrifice for the colony and then regenerating. It uses decomposing spray when it can hit multiple targets. Otherwise, it uses its staff to bludgeon enemies.

The myconid sovereign remains behind its allies, relying on them for protection. It uses commanding spores to make certain its allies continue to protect it. It uses spore burst even when enemies are engaged in melee with its allies (since they’re all plants, they are immune to the effect).

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** Dim. The bioluminescent fungi on the wall provides a candlelike glow to the main chamber of this area.

**Central Pool:** The water in the pool is about three and a half feet deep, serving as difficult terrain for Medium creatures. Small creatures must swim. The water in the pool is tinged with virulent spores that act like a poison—any nonplant that enters or starts its turn in the water gains ongoing poison 1 (save ends).

**Skull Piles:** Simple trophies. Among the recent tengu heads are very old goblin and human skulls. A skull pile is high enough to provide concealment against ranged attacks.

**Corner Detritus:** Though not thick enough to serve as difficult terrain, the remains of barrels, crates, kegs, and other storage vessels swept into the corners of this chamber make it easy to determine that the chamber was once a cellar for storing food and spirits.

**Side Caves:** These areas are cooler than the main area, and the myconids spend much of their time there in spore-induced communion with each other and the lesser plants.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> Treasure: A small, rusted iron chest is lodged in the wall of the western cave. The chest is locked (DC 18 Thievery check to open). The well-padded interior holds a [[potion-patch-tv|Potion Patch (Moderate)]] and a [[lifelink-surge-som|Spell scroll (2nd level) (Lifelink Surge)]].

# Encounter T3: Mausoleum
**Encounter Difficulty:** Severe (120 xp)

![[SCT E3 Map.webp]]

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 10: [[tengu-tribal|Tengu Tribal]] T
 - 2: [[specter|Specter]] S
 - 1: [[wraith|Wraith]] W

```encounter
name: Mausoleum
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 10: [[Tengu Tribal]] 
- 2: [[Specter]]
- 1: [[Wraith]]
```

Tengus inhabit the western part of this chamber, careful not to disturb spirits that haunt the place. If they hear the party, they hide ([[skills#Perception|Perception]] DC 26 to spot one) and attack only when the PCs come closer to the mausoleum. The undead do not emerge until after combat begins.

When PCs see the area, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> To the east, a glowing pool fills a cistern. To the west, a smoky campfire burns between four stone coffins. Two coffins are sealed and two are cracked open. 
> 
> **[[skills#Arcana|Arcana]] Check**
> DC 25: The pool has a strong but chaotic magical aura. Multiple effects mix in that aura, obscuring your ability to discern one from another.
> DC 29: Beneficial magic, probably similar to that conferred by rituals, resides in the water. The mixture might have dangerous side effects, however.

When PCs see into the mausoleum, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Three sealed crypts line the western wall. A fossilized skeleton of a dragon, half chiseled out of a block of stone and free of clutter, rests like a shrine to necromancy along the south wall. Remnants of fires, past meals, bedding, crude implements for spear making, and similar bits are scattered everywhere. Scattered black feathers are prominent among the debris.

When the tengus attack, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Ravenlike humanoids rush from cover to attack you. One of them shouts, “Don’t let the intruders touch the holy dragon!” 
> 
> **[[skills#Arcana|Arcana]] Check**
> DC 25: The skeleton has a slight necrotic aura. It might be dangerous, but if so, the effect is unlikely to be very potent.
> 
> **[[sense-motive|Sense Motive]] Check** 
> DC 23: The tengu’s words lack conviction. Perhaps the skeleton is a trap of some sort.

## Tactics
The tengus move away from the skeleton, hoping the PCs try to touch it, which the tengu’s know rouses the undead to attack. If the characters do touch the skeleton, the undead target them and ignore the tengus. If the PCs don’t disturb the skeleton during the first round, a tengu does during the second round—likely by hurling a javelin at it. Tribals far from enemies use their ranged javelin attacks, but those close enough try to use their flock effect to gain the attack bonus. 

When the skeleton is touched or disturbed, such as by being attacked or in the area of an attack, the undead phase out of their crypts and attack. The specters begin invisible. If the tengus disturbed the skeleton, the undead occasionally attack one of them but prefer the PCs’ stronger life force and power.

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** Bright.

**Magic Fountain:** A magic fountain lies in the hallway east of the Mausoleum. The Stormcrow Company managed to move a magic fountain from the tower of an evil wizard they overthrew to their own base. The fountain’s reliability suffered in the transport. It confers an ability or disability upon each person that drinks from the fountain no more than 1/day. The fountain confers effects similar to rituals where the skill check to perform the ritual, if any is required, is +10. However, it may also confer a disease!

###### `dice: 1d6` Ability
| Die Roll |  Effect |
| ---- | --- |
| 1 | [[nightmare-fever|Nightmare Fever]] |

| 4 | [[discern-lies|Discern Lies]] |
| 5 | [[talking-corpse|Talking Corpse]] |
| 6 | [[create-undead|Create Undead]] |

**Drain:** The drain was used by the Emerald Warlock to catch excess blood from victims of his experiments. Now it is a grating for campfires.

**Dragon Skeleton:** This relic of a dead monster is charged with just enough residual power to rouse the undead in the chamber if disturbed.

**Stone Coffins:** Two of the coffins are open and empty; two are closed, and names are chiseled on their faces. One name is Illugi Swordbreaker, the other is Emerald Warlock. Opening either coffin (DC 25 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check) reveals a humanoid body in each. If the PCs drank from the magic fountain in the hallway leading to this chamber, one may have the ability to use Talking Corpse. They can try their luck on one of the bodies to learn what happened to the Stormcrows. The dead one volunteers one final bit of information; “Take the key in my crypt—use it to bypass the Force Door that seals Agera of the Shadow Face’s final redoubt.”

A platinum key is hidden amid the dust in one of the coffins ([[skills#Perception|Perception]] DC 23 to find it without the aid of the hint; no check needed with the hint).

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> The coffins also holds 11 gp and [[poison-fizz-tv|Poison Fizz (Lesser)]].

# Encounter T4: Lightning Hall
**Encounter Difficulty:** Varies based on Traps overcome (Level 8 Hazards 20 xp each; Level 9 Hazard 30 xp)

![[SCT E4 Map.webp]]

Deeper access is sealed behind a magical wall of force and a flaring expanse of lightning. The room at the west end of the hallway is only an empty lure.

> [[force-burst-wall-hb|Force Burst Wall]]

> [!danger]+ Trap

# Encounter T5: Hall of Summoning
**Encounter Difficulty:** Varies (20 xp per magma scorpion defeated)

![[SCT E5 Map.webp]]

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 4: [[magma-scorpion|Magma Scorpion]] W

```encounter
name: Hall of Summoning
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 4: [[Magma Scorpion]] 
```

```encounter
name: Summoned Scorpion
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 1: [[Magma Scorpion]]
```

Agera of the Shadow Face’s paranoia led her to entrench herself behind a series of dangerous chambers. She perverted what had been Illugi Swordbreaker’s weapon practice chamber, which summoned worthy foes for Illugi to deal with, into a chamber that summons monsters, one after the next, until the enchantment is broken.

When PCs first see the room, they observe that the chamber seems empty (don’t place the monsters). However, when any creature enters 3 or more squares into the chamber, the brazier flares; roll initiative at that time.

The first time the central brazier flares, it summons 4 magma scorpions, one to each summoning circle. On each subsequent round, on its initiative, the brazier summons a new magma scorpion which appears in one of the summoning circles (determine tactically) in an open square.

When players see the room, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> This chamber is brightly lit by a violently burning brazier of fire. Four glowing sigil circles are scribed in the floor, one per corner. 
> 
> **Arcana Check** 
> DC 21: The circles are summoning circles, and the brazier at the room’s center is a summoning device. Destroying it should end any summoning here.

## Tactics
The brazier continues summoning additional magma scorpions until it is disabled or it has summoned a total of eight magma scorpions in an 8-hour period. The summoned creatures pursue the PCs even if the heroes leave this chamber.

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** Bright. The central brazier lights the whole room.

**Summoning Circles:** Glowing inscriptions serve as a focus for the magic that summons monsters to this chamber, which emanates from the brazier.

**Summoning Brazier:** The brazier summons creatures as noted under Setup and Tactics. A character can attack the brazier (hp 75); Destroying it ends the summoning effect permanently.

# Encounter T6: What's My Name
**Encounter Difficulty:** Moderate (80 xp)

![[SCT E6 Map.webp]]

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 4: [[glass-golem|Glass Golem]] A

```encounter
name: Whats My Name
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 4: [[Glass Golem]]
```

Before the madness that brought them low, Stormcrow Company prepared a special puzzle test chamber designed to provide those with “permission” to move into their ultimate vault chamber where the mercenaries stored their most significant loot.

The constructs are visible in the chamber as shown on the tactical map. They do not activate until attacked, however, or until a PC incorrectly moves all of the raven statues onto the letter grid.

When PCs see the chamber, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Four statues are arranged near the northern entrance. To the south, a grid of letters is inscribed in the floor.
> 
> C U I N
> B R M L
> S G O A
> E P Q W
> 
> Several partly humanoid constructs flank the letter grid, motionless.
> 
> A niche on the south wall glows with faintly purple light.
> 
> **Arcana Check**
> DC 18: The purple light is the weak manifestation of a closed magical portal.

![[4D - Stormcrow Tor (D169)-20240502100600756.webp]]
[[4D - Stormcrow Tor (D169)-20240502100540234.webp|Show to Players]]

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** Dark. The portal sheds dim light in its square and into adjacent squares. When activated, it flares to bright light and illuminates the whole chamber.

**Statues:** Investigation shows these statues aren’t attached to the floor, and that they’re lighter then they appear. Each one can be moved a number of squares equal 1 + a character’s Strength modifier per move action expended.  The statues fit nicely on any of the letter tiles in the letter grid to the south.

**Letter Grid:** The letters, inscribed in the Common script, are arranged as noted on the previous page. If the letters that spell out CROW are each covered by a statue or similarly heavy object, the portal in the southern wall flares into life and remains active while the statues remain on their squares.

**Portal:** Once activated, this portal provides instant transportation from this chamber to the portal niche in room 7. Walking through the portal is part of a move action, and those appearing on the other side can continue to move up the limit of their speed when they arrive. Those who arrive in room 7 discover the portal is apparently one way (at least at first).

# Encounter T7: Stormcrow Vault Room
**Encounter Difficulty:** Severe (130 xp)

![[SCT E7 Map.webp]]

At the start of the encounter, place the following foes on the map: 
 - 6: [[levaloch|Infernal Armor]] I
 - 1: [[Agera of the Shadow Face]] A

```encounter
name: Stormcrow Vault Room
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 6: [[Levaloch, Infernal Armor]] 
- 1: [[Agera of the Shadow Face]]
```

![[4D - Stormcrow Tor (D169)-20240502101334280.webp|left|700]]
[[4D - Stormcrow Tor (D169)-20240502101334280.webp|Show to Players]]

When Agera of the Shadow Face won the battle against her fellows, she retreated to the vault chamber and lay down to “sleep” with the Chaosheart around her neck. Decades later, Agera yet sleeps, though her body died long ago. Her mind, however, is tied to the Chaosheart. If this chamber is invaded, Agera awakens to defend it, as insane as ever.

When the players appear through the portal in the west wall, provide the read-aloud text. The levalochs initially appear as part of the general detritus littering each smashed vault, until they “activate.”

If a PC enters one of the corner crypts, opens the sarcophagus in the center of the chamber, or interacts with anything on the workbench, Agera emerges from her sarcophagus. Roll initiative! The levalochs rise as a free action on their turn, two from each broken vault.

When PCs enter the chamber, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> This wide chamber is dominated by a stone sarcophagus which sits upon a hellish design painted on the floor in glistening blood. Three of the corners hold smashed-in vault doors. The southeast corner instead contains a workbench and chair, though a ward of blue-glowing glyphs surrounds it protectively.

When PCs trigger Agera’s appearance, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The sarcophagus cover explodes! Standing in the swirling dust is an emaciated tiefling woman who looks more devil than human, and all dead. A red stone on an iron chain blazes on her chest. She screams, “No one can have the Chaosheart but me! You’ll die, just like all the rest. Perhaps it will be your souls that will finally pay my way into Kataklysmos presence!”

## Tactics
If it becomes clear that the heroes will likely win the fight, Agera calls on Kataklysmos to “Strike down these mortal shells, as you did Illugi Swordbreaker and the Emerald Warlock. Take their souls, as you did my former compatriots, as my sacrifice to you!” Nothing comes of this, but it may give the PCs a moment of uncertainty before their triumph.

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** Bright. The activated portal provides bright purplish light throughout the chamber.

![[Kataklysmos-Symbol.webp|left|400]]
[[Kataklysmos-Symbol.webp|Show to Players]]

**Symbol of Kataklysmos:** The Chaosheart’s presence makes the blood making up this symbol remain fresh. If the Chaosheart is removed from the chamber, the blood finally dries. The symbol area is difficult terrain, and anyone besides Agera subject to forced movement on the symbol must succeed on a saving throw or fall prone. A creature standing in a square of the symbol or the sarcophagus can score a critical hit on a natural roll of 19 or 20.

**Portal:** Initially, the portal that transports PCs into the chamber is one way. (DC 27 [[skills#Arcana|Arcana]] check to force the portal to work in reverse). The PCs can activate the portal in both directions by using the key found on the workbench.

**Work Bench:** The workbench contains a crystalline key that makes the portal operate both ways, Agera’s Journal (which begins in Common but switches to Infernal toward the end, after the journal indicates Stormcrow Company found the Chaosheart). Prior to that point, the journal reads like any successful adventuring party’s journal might read. After acquiring the Chaosheart, Agera becomes more and more paranoid, until she finally indicates she’s had enough! The last entry states only, “Kataklysmos, you have shown me the truth!”

**Treasure Vaults:** Rubble shown on the map here is difficult terrain. The vaults are smashed and looted (scorch marks and the smell of brimstone indicates devils may have been responsible), but among the debris, the players find the what remains below.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> In the treasure vault the players find 254 gp, 8 sp, [[armor-potency|+1 Armor Potency Chain Shirt]], [[Wraithweave Patch (Type I)]], [[war-razor-tv|+2 Weapon Potency War Razor]], [[wovenwood-shield-lotgb|Wovenwood Shield (Moderate)]], [[flame-barrier|Spell scroll (4th level) (Flame Barrier)]], [[draw-the-lightning-som|Spell scroll (4th level) (Draw The Lightning)]] and [[lashuntas-life-bubble-gw1|Spell scroll (5th level) (Lashunta's Life Bubble)]]

> [!warning]
> Chaosheart: Depending on the players actions here this item may need further development.  Kind of go with the flow on what the think it is and what they want to do about it.
