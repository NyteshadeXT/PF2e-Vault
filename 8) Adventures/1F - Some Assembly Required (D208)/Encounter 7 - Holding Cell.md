The kobolds have converted this former office into a prison cell. The sole occupant is Zeta Windsnap, the missing girl from Dardun. 
Light: Bright light (oil lantern). 

When the characters come near the door, read: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A door with a horizontal slot cut into the center is set into a small alcove ahead. The door is wrapped with a thick chain and locked with a heavy padlock. Suddenly, a frail human hand shoots out through the slot, reaching for you. In a desperate whisper, a young girl’s voice says, “Help me! Quick! Please!” 

**The Cell Door:** The lock on the door is a good one ([[skills#Thievery|Thievery]] DC 20 to open), and the door is made of thick wood (Hardness 10, HP 40, BT 20). Breaking the door open requires a successful DC 24 [[../../rules/actions/force-open|Force Open]]-Athletics checks. The sound of smashing the door attracts two kobold patrols. 

Zeta knows the guards have a key, and they most recently went somewhere to the south. The kobold wild mage, Jiro, currently holds the key in area 10. 

**The Missing Girl:** Zeta Windsnap is hungry and bruised but in good health. She answers any of the party’s questions that she can. See the “Lore” section below. 

If freed, the plucky girl asks for a dagger or short sword. The kid’s got heart, but she’s no warrior. In combat, treat her as a minion (defenses 10; hp 1). If told to return home, she reluctantly leaves the group, but she hides in the woods and rejoins the characters when they emerge from the mine. 

**Lore:** Zeta’s brother Kevmar went out alone in search of the night beasts. She followed him and hid in the bushes. When the kobolds attacked Kevmar, she leaped forward and stabbed one of the creatures in the chest, mortally wounding it. The kobolds cut her brother down and beat her severely. That’s when she lost consciousness. 

When Zeta awoke, she was in a large cavern. Kobolds were everywhere, building a machine bigger than a house. She saw a robed kobold shouting from a pedestal next to a jar almost as big as he was, but she couldn’t understand what he was saying. They dragged her to this room, where she’s been ever since. The kobolds have not fed her
