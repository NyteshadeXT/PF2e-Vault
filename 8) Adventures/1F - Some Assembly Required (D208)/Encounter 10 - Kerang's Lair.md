After more than a century in hibernation, Kerang is frantic to be free of his glass prison—the embalming jar that houses his brain. 
**Light:** Bright (oil lanterns). 

Monsters: Kerang (kobold dragon construct), Jiro (kobold wild mage), 2 kobold dragonshields, 10 kobold tunnelers. 

When the characters can see the area, read: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The passage widens into a gigantic rock cavern filled with scaffolding and stacks of construction materials. An enormous dragon sculpture dominates the center of the room. The sculpture is a mishmash of dragon bone and metal plates, held together with bailing wire, struts, and leather bindings. A huge pair of canvas wings is drawn in close to its back. A cracked dragon skull adorns the top of a long neck studded with metal spikes. 
> 
> A robed kobold barks orders as a team of kobolds lowers a giant glass jar filled with murky water into a hatch on the dragon sculpture. You see something fat and pale gurgling just below the water’s surface as the hatch snaps shut. 

When the characters enter battle, read: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The robed kobold spies you and screams (in Draconic), “Intruders! Master, protect us!” The sculpture springs to life. Canvas wings suddenly spread open with a sound like a cracking whip, sending out a gust of wind that knocks several kobolds from their scaffolds. 
> 
> The dragon construct rears up on its hind legs with a roar that shakes the chamber. “WHO DARES DISTURB KERANG?” A cotter pin shoots from its mooring and makes a pinging sound as it rebounds off the cave wall. The beast’s forearms crash back to the earth, squashing a slow moving kobold to a red pulp. 

If the characters succeeded in the “Hot on the Trail” encounter, add: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A large metal breastplate falls from the construct and clatters to the floor, revealing an empty cavity and a detached hose. You have apparently arrived before Kerang’s construction was complete.

Kerang’s new body stands at the center of the chamber, surrounding by rickety scaffolding. The dragon’s trusted follower, Jiro, stands next to the altar, delivering Kerang’s orders to the workers. 

> [!warning]
> If the adventurers were successful in the “Hot on the Trail” encounter, Kerang’s breath weapon does not recharge, and only the effect of fiery explosion works. Other than Jiro, the dragon cares little for his minions. Jiro and the other kobolds fight to protect their master to their last breath.
