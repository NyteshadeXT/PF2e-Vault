Supply rooms in this area are used as a barracks. 
**Light:** Bright light (oil lanterns). 

**6A. Main Barracks:** [[skills#Perception|Perception]] DC 8: You hear loud yipping voices in an argument behind the door. Two wyrmpriests argue over who gets to bunk closest to Jiro, the kobold wild mage favored by Kerang. They are surrounded by a few onlookers (one dragonshield and two tunnelers). Jiro’s quarters are separated behind a filthy curtain. The kobold wild mage is spending all his time in Kerang’s chamber now. If combat breaks out, the six tunnelers in area 6B awake and join the fray.
