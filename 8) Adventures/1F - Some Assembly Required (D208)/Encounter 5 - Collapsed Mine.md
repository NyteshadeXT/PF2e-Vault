In the long-forgotten calamity that befell this mine, the passages to this section collapsed. Many miners were trapped here and live on in undead misery. 
**Light:** None.  

When the characters enter 5A, read: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A rickety wooden elevator platform occupies this room. Rusted iron rungs are anchored into the rock wall, allowing passage to the shaft below. The air is stuffy and full of dust. 
> 
> [[skills#Perception|Perception]] DC 15: A human figure struggles under a fallen support beam to the south. 

When the characters approach 5B, read: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A zombified human corpse in tattered robes is pinned beneath a heavy wooden beam that fell from the ceiling. It hisses and flails around, trying to grab your legs. The creature must have been trapped here for decades. Deep grooves have been carved into the rock floor, and the fingers on the creature’s hands have been worn to nubs as it tried to free itself. A wand and purse are cinched to its leather belt. 

When the zombies emerge from 5C, read: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Moaning wails and the sounds of shuffling feet break the stillness. A throng of restless undead shambles into view. 

**5A. Upper Mine Elevator:** Rusted iron rails lead to an elevator platform. Presumably, mine carts were once raised and lowered here, but it’s questionable whether the platform could support such weight now. The elevator mechanism is still functional, but excessive weight could cause it to break, dumping its occupants into the 40-foot-deep shaft below. Iron rungs in the wall lead down to area 5E. 

**5B. Fallen Foreman:** This passageway is unremarkable except for a solitary zombie trapped beneath a support beam on the floor. The poor soul was once the mine’s foreman. The zombie is considered to be helpless. Noise in this area attracts the attention of the zombies in area 5C. 

Treasure: At his waist, the zombie foreman carries a wand of digging and a purse containing 27 sp and dried figs. The wand of digging is a metal wand tipped with a tiny shovel head. The wand can be used once per day to blast through two 5-foot squares of natural rock. The accompanying explosion can be heard up to 50 squares away. 

5C. Ore Deposit: Undead are often drawn to mindlessly carry out the tasks they performed while living. The zombie miners mill around a rich vein of silver ore. There are several high-purity silver deposits on the rock surface. A character with a mining pick could break off five chunks worth 10 gp each. The zombies shamble toward any loud noise in the collapsed mine area.

5D. Cave-In: The ceiling has collapsed in this area. It would take five workers an hour to clear a 5-foot square of debris.

5E. Lower Mine Elevator: Two sets of iron rails converge on a square of recessed floor under a tall shaft. Metal rungs are set in the rock wall. A pictograph is painted low on the wall in white paint. It shows an arrow pointing up next to a skull and crossbones.
