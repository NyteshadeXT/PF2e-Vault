The kobolds keep their weasels in a large cage when not on patrol. 

**Light:** Bright light (torches). 

When the characters enter the room, read: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Whips, leashes, and bridles hang on the wall in this large chamber. Enormous rats sniff at the air behind a 15-foot-high makeshift pen. Two kobolds are here. 

The rats cannot leave the pen unless someone opens the gate. Each quickblade starts 6 squares from the gate. If the pen is closed, a quickblade rushes over on its turn and opens the gate as a minor action. The rats then fight alongside the kobolds
