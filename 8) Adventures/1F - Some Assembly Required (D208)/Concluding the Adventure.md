Once the adventurers have defeated Kerang, any kobolds remaining in the mine slink away into the countryside. Jiro has a key that can be used to unlock  [[Zeta Windsnap]]'s cell. If the characters released her earlier, she is hiding in the bushes outside the mine, waiting to go with the party back to Restwell Keep. 

If the characters were captured by Kerang and later escaped, the kobolds continue to fortify the mine and hold [[Zeta Windsnap]] captive.  

Should the adventurers decide not to pursue Kerang at all, the dragon arrives at Restwell Keep four days later and razes it to the ground. He continues to fortify his stronghold while launching attacks against the surrounding lands.
