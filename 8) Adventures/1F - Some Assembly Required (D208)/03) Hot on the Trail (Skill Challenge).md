# Clue 1: Kevmar's Body

If the party investigates the body:

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The guard leads you to a field on the outskirts of the keep where you find [[Kendon Longstrider - Baliff|Kendon]] already waiting for you.  There is a small body lying under at tarp.  Upon investigation you see that the corpse is covered in puncture wounds on the front and back.

-   [[skills#Medicine|Medicine]] (DC 10): Kevmar’s wounds are the result of piercing weapons, most likely spears or javelins.
-   [[skills#Perception|Perception]] (DC 15): The angle of the wounds suggests the attackers were small of stature.

# Clue 2: Witnesses

This clue can take place immediately after clue 1 or anytime while the adventurers are asking around the keep. Eyewitness testimony is notoriously unreliable. The witness in this case embellishes the story. When the adventurers are ready, read:

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
>A plump farmer steps forward, claiming to have seen one of the monsters.

-   [[skills#Deception|Deception]] (DC 15): The peasants are not used to being addressed with deference. The witness eagerly offers the following not-entirely-reliable information: “Looked like lil’ dragons, they did. Carried off me favorite sheep.”
-  [[skills#Intimidation|Intimidation]] (DC 15): The villagers are wary of ruffians and slick talkers. The witness backpedals from having seen the creatures very well. It was dark and they were in shadow. The beasts were small and reptilian, and they made yipping noises when they spoke.

# Clue 3: Burglarized Shed

The burglarized shed is located near the field where Kevmar's corpse is found. A trail of dropped nails leads from the shed to clue 4.

When the adventurers are ready, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
>A large woman in a sun hat waves to get your attention. “One of my sheds was broke into a few nights ago. No one’s gone inside since. I can take you there, if you like.”

-  [[skills#Perception|Perception]] (Rogue Only DC 10): The theft is the work of amateurs. They obviously came in through the unlocked window above the workbench. The thieves would have to be small to fit through the window.
-  [[skills#Perception|Perception]] (All Others DC 15): The character realizes that searching around the outside of the shed might be a good idea. The search turns up a purple crystal. A trail of dropped nails leads to clue 4.

# Clue 4: Footprints

This clue is found in a grassy field on the edge of town. The party can discover it by following the trail of dropped nails from the burglarized shed.

When the adventurers are ready, read:

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The glint of metal attracts your eye to a patch of tall grass near. Among the reeds, you spot a dagger crusted in dried blood. Several sets of clawed feet have left impressions in the soft earth. A trail of footprints leads north but quickly fades away.

-  [[skills#Perception|Perception]] (DC 15): The footprints wind through a cornfield. Every twenty or thirty feet, dried blood spatters can be spotted on the ground or terrain. After the trail reaches a small thicket of trees, it turns west, toward the King's Wall. A dead kobold is slumped against a nearby tree, clutching at a wound in its chest. A rolled sheet of paper in its pocket shows a technical drawing of a wing made of canvas. Scribbled measurements show that the wing is over ten feet long.
-  [[skills#Nature|Nature]] (DC 15): A search of the corpse reveals rock dust under the fingernails and toe claws, possibly from a mine or cave. The drawing of the wing is also discovered (if it hasn’t already been found).

# Clue 5: Sigil of Kerang

This clue can be found after following the kobold footprints or searching farther outside the keep. The sigil is carved into a tree.

When the adventurers are ready, read:

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> You spot a crude emblem cut into a gnarled oak. Judging from the dripping sap, the carving was recently engraved. The emblem depicts a haloed dragon.

-  [[skills#Society|Society]] (DC 15): The symbol has local historical importance to some of the villagers. If the check result is 19 or higher, the character immediately recalls the terrible tale of Kerang the Red Dragon, slain over a hundred years ago in the mountains nearby (see the “Background” section).
-  [[skills#Religion|Religion]] (DC 15): Humanoid species often carve symbols into trees to mark territory for their gods. The halo shows that this symbol holds a religious connotation.

# Success or Failure

The characters succeed if they decipher three or more clues. Otherwise, they fail. 

**Success:** The adventurers have won a small victory against Kerang. Award each character 5 XP per successfully deciphered clue. Quickly discovering the source of the kobold incursions allows the party to reach Kerang’s lair before his new body is completed. See the “Development” section of encounter 10. 

[[Kendon Longstrider - Baliff|Kendon]] can answer any questions the characters have while they are in town. The rock dust and purple crystal shards most likely came from an abandoned mine half a day’s travel to the west, beyond the King's Wall. If needed, [[Kendon Longstrider - Baliff|Kendon]] can draw the party a rough map to the location. 

**Failure:** The characters’ inaction or bungling has caused them to lose precious time. Night falls and one of the farmhouses is set on fire, mortally wounding a farmhand. Before he dies, he tells the adventurers that he was attacked by kobolds, and he identifies the direction in which they fled. If the party sets out in pursuit, a kobold patrol springs an ambush (see [[8) Adventures/1J - The Kobold Hall (DMG)/01) Running the Adventure#Kobolds|Kobolds]] under [[8) Adventures/1J - The Kobold Hall (DMG)/01) Running the Adventure]]). Any of the kobolds can tell the adventurers where the mine is. If all members of the patrol die, at least one kobold has a purple crystal, which [[Kendon Longstrider - Baliff|Kendon]] can identify for the characters, sending the party to the old mine
