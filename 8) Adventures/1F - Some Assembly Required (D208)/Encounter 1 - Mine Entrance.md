The mine entrance is guarded by a stout wooden door and is barred from the inside. Murder holes have been chiseled into the walls on each side of the door.

When the party can see the area, read: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A pair of rusted iron rails leads to a cavity cut into the mountainside and disappears behind a heavy wooden door. The opening is buttressed with heavy wooden beams. Many small openings are cut into the rock on either side of the door. 

[[skills#Perception|Perception]] DC 19: Light reflects off small pairs of eyes peering through openings in the rock. 

If a character looks for another entrance, read: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Directly above the mine entrance, high on the steep rock wall, two metal pipes jut into the air. Corroded metal grates cover the openings.

If the party waits stealthily, the characters see kobold groups enter and exit the mine every few hours from dusk until dawn. The groups use the passphrase “Ha eltak Kerang” (“Hail Kerang” in Draconic) to enter. 

**1A. Entrance:** Iron rails lead through this room and deeper into the tunnels. Refuse litters the floor here. The kobolds have fortified this antechamber with a barred door (Hardness 10, HP 40, BT 20);. Breaking the door open requires a successful DC 25 [[../../rules/actions/force-open|Force Open]]-Athletics checks. The door can be unbarred from inside the room. Murder holes have been cut into the rock around the door. 

**1B. Ventilation Shaft:** Fifty feet above the entrance on a steep rock wall ([[../../rules/actions/climb|Climb]]-Athletics DC 15 to climb), two large ventilation pipes are visible. Metal grates cover the shafts, but the locks are brittle and oxidized ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] DC 12 to break or [[skills#Thievery|Thievery]] DC 12 to pick). Inside, the shafts have maintenance ladders. Sound is amplified, so a DC 10 [[skills#Stealth|Stealth]] check is required to avoid attracting attention. The shafts open just behind the mine entrance.

## Tactics
The kobolds guarding the mine entrance are vigilant. They keep the door barred unless a kobold patrol is passing through. Unless directly targeted by attacks, the guards hide at the murder holes and wait to attack until their enemies approach the door. The last kobold standing flees. 

## Development 
The mine entrance is far enough from the kobold base of operations that the din of battle attracts no attention from other kobolds. If any kobolds flee, they head for the mine carts and try to reach the others
