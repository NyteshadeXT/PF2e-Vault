Kerang and his kobold cohorts have taken up residence in a decrepit mine in the Briar Hills. The kobolds have retrofitted the mine with deadly traps and secret passageways. If captured or fleeing, they do their best to steer intruders into the hazards. The traps below show up at several keyed locations on the map. Disabling a trap at one location does not automatically disable it at all locations. The party must deal with the threats individually.

# T1. Tripwire Trap 
A tripwire is set 3.5 feet off the ground. Small creatures, such as halflings, gnomes, and kobolds, can pass underneath. The tripwire is made of woven spider silk and is difficult to detect.

# T2. Covered Pit 
A flimsy board is covered in dirt and placed over a shallow spiked pit. Small creatures can run across the board, but the weight of larger creatures breaks it in half.

# T3. Small Tunnels 
The kobolds have added tunnels to the mine that better suit them. The tunnels are built to scale for Small creatures. Medium or larger creatures need to squeeze and travel in single file to crawl through the passages.

# Captured! 
Kerang, the kobolds’ dragon master, is eager to lord his power over defeated foes. His minions deliver unconscious characters to Kerang’s lair, where they are stripped of all weapons and implements and locked in a large cage. The dragon-brain-in-a-jar harangues the adventurers about his plan to destroy the descendants of his enemies. 

Although Kerang never sleeps and his workers constantly move through the lair, captured characters might be able to slip away. [[Zeta Windsnap]] could sneak out of her cell and create a diversion to help the party escape. If a character has thieves’ tools or a thin piece of metal, the lock on the cage can be picked with a DC 18 [[skills#Thievery|Thievery]] check. The door could also be smashed open with a DC 20 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics] check. The adventurers’ weapons are in plain sight atop Kerang’s hoard beside his altar. 

Once the construction of his body is complete, Kerang blasts through the rock wall to escape. The dragon launches into the air while clutching the cage in his iron talons. He immediately heads for Restwell Keep. Kerang drops the cage on a hilltop facing the keep and razes it to the ground. This situation is the characters’ last chance to escape.
