## Rests 
As the player characters venture deeper into the mine, taking rests becomes more problematic. Short rests should be uneventful, but the adventurers need to take precautions before an extended rest. More than one extended rest also forfeits the effects the party receives from successful completion of the “Hot on the Trail” encounter. In addition, the kobolds might have time to reinforce their positions. Use your best judgment when resetting traps and encounters.

## Kobolds 
The kobolds have trained giant rats, which they use in battle and sometimes as mounts. Try playing up the humorous side of the kobolds. They would be downright comical if it weren’t for their malevolence. Kobold patrols travel in and out of the mine, delivering fresh supplies. If you need one, a patrol consists of

[[Kobold-Scout|Kobold Scout]]
[[Giant-Rat|Giant Rat]]

```encounter-table
name: Kobold Patrol 1
creatures:
 - 3: Kobold Scout

---

name: Kobold Patrol 2
creatures:
 - 2: Kobold Scout
 - Giant Rat
