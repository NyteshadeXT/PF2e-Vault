The first area of the deep mine contains a checkpoint and a storeroom. 
**Light:** Dim light (luminescent crystals). 

When the party approaches 3A, read: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A barricade of timber and spikes has been set up on the track, blocking mine carts from moving farther. Two side tracks accommodate another mine cart and a handcar. 

**3A. Guard Post:** A spare mine cart and a handcar are located on a side track here. The handcar, operated by two people, can be used to haul up to two mine carts at a time back to the mine entrance. A crude barricade blocks further passage by mine cart. 

**3B. Chutes and Rock Piles:** Behind two 3-foothigh rock piles lurk the kobolds ([[skills#Perception|Perception]] DC 18 to spot the creatures). If they are not spotted, the kobolds gain a surprise round.

```encounter

creatures:

```

Directly in front of the rock piles are two limestone chutes, each one covered by a stretched tarp and dirt ([[skills#Perception|Perception]] DC 18 to detect). Any creature stepping on a chuteâ€™s square must make a saving throw; success means the creature falls prone in the square it left to step into the chute, and failure means a fall into the chute. The creature can attempt a DC 12 [[grab-an-edge|Grab an Edge]] check to arrest the fall and climb back out of the chute (also a move action). A creature that fails to do so falls to area 8B. 

**3C. Crystal Pool:** Purple crystals line the walls around this pool. Some of the larger crystals can be broken off and use as light sources. Once harvested in this manner, a crystal gives off dim purple light for three months. 

**3D. Storeroom:** The many shelves in this chamber suggest that it was once a storeroom, but almost all the supplies have long since disappeared. Roll three times on the Mundane Items table. 

**3E. Storage Closet:** This enormous closet is filled with trash and empty crates.
