The mine carts stored in this area can be used to travel quickly to the deep mine. If a kobold fled in the last encounter, the characters catch a glimpse of it making a getaway in a mine cart. 

**Light:** Dim light (luminescent crystals).

As the characters enter 2A, read: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The iron tracks fork here and continue in parallel into a long tunnel. A weathered plaque over the tunnel reads “Deep Mine this way.” Dimly glowing purple crystals have been set into the tunnel walls at regular intervals. A pair of mine carts sits on a side track. A metal door is slightly ajar on the south wall. 

**2A. Cart Storage:** Mine carts are stored in the area when not in use. The carts are constructed of thick iron reinforced with riveted steel bands. 

**2B. Repair Room:** A few lengths of iron rail and a mine cart without wheels shows that this room is probably used for maintenance tasks. A search turns up mundane items (roll three times on the Mundane Items table) and a ten-foot wooden pole. 

**2C. Tunnel to Deep Mine:** At the halfway point to the deep mine, kobolds attack the party. Area 2C on the map is an abstraction of a long, descending tunnel that accommodates the mine chase, as described in the “Mine Chase” section below.

When the kobolds attack, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Suddenly, you hear the piercing squeal of metal on metal from a side tunnel. Four mine carts full of kobolds explode onto the track in a shower of sparks.

## Mine Chase 
This moving cart battle happens in a part of the mine where the tracks diverge into three sections. The characters start in the center of track 2 with kobolds on each side. The kobolds ride in four carts, each cart holding one kobold slinger and two kobold tunnelers.

```encounter
name: Mine Enterance Encounter
creatures:
 - 2: Kobold Minion, 1, 15, 8
 - Kobold Scout
```

**Setup:** To begin the encounter, place one mine cart of kobolds in the start area on track 1 and another on track 3. When all kobolds in a cart are killed, remove the cart and add another with the same initiative on a random track at the start of the next round. Repeat until all four carts of kobolds have been destroyed. If the characters were pursuing a fleeing kobold, be sure to place it in a mine cart on the track ahead of them. 

**Mine Carts:** Large crystals fixed to the front and back give off bright light when the cart is in motion. Each cart measures almost 10 feet square and can accommodate four passengers. The carts roll easily on the tracks and pick up speed quickly in the downward sloping tunnel. The carts have no controls other than simple hand brakes on the fore and aft. A cart offers cover to standing creatures and superior cover to prone creatures. 

**Moving:** The mine carts move at a speed of 6 when rolling downhill. Any combatant in a cart can take a move action to use the following mine cart terrain powers. For the purpose of triggering any attack, moving a mine cart is considered to be forced movement.

> [!note]+ Call Out
> **Move Actions**
> *Shift Weight*
> Requirement: The creature must be in one of the affected mine cart’s squares. 
> Effect: The mine cart moves forward 1 square on its track. All creatures in the mine cart move with the terrain. 
> 
> *Apply Brakes*
> Requirement: The creature must be in one of the affected mine cart’s squares. 
> Effect: The mine cart moves back 1 square on its track. All creatures in the mine cart move with the terrain

When running this encounter, assume that the mine carts are moving at a constant speed of 6. Rather than moving the carts 6 squares forward every round plus any terrain power movement, track the relative positions of objects on the battlefield. To stay in the fight, a creature on the ground must keep pace with the carts. 

**Battle Events:** At the end of every round, roll a random effect on the Mine Chase Events table. The mine carts cannot change tracks unless indicated by a random event.

## Travel by Foot 
Traveling to the deep mine by foot takes roughly ninety minutes. If the characters take the time to explore every side tunnel turnout, they encounter the kobolds at the turnout closest to area 2C. Run the encounter on foot. 

If the party marches past the turnout without stopping to explore it, invite the players to roll initiative and place their characters anywhere on the leftmost portion of the map. On the kobolds’ initiative count, their mine carts rush down tracks 1 and 3 and screech to a halt at the rightmost portion of the encounter map. All characters standing on a square in track 1 or 3 must succeed on an [[skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check (DC 19) or take `dice: 1d10+4` damage. Those whose check result is 15 or lower also fall prone. 

## Conclusion 
After the encounter, the rest of the trip to the deep mine is uneventful. The tracks lead to the deep mine checkpoint at area 3A.
