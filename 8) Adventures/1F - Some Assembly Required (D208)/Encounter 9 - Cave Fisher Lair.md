The high ceiling in this naturally cut cavern once made the room an ideal storage area. Now that cave fishers have taken up residence here, the kobolds avoid this chamber. 
**Light:** None. 

When the characters enter 9A, read: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Two wide ledges—one 20 feet high, the other 40 feet high— hug the walls of this tall cave. Dusty chests and wooden containers line the walls, stacked toward the high ceiling. At the far end of the room, the top half of a large crate has been wrenched off. 

When the characters come close to 9B, read: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The hay and loose packing material stuffed in the broken crate begin to move. Several pink creatures emerge, chittering as they flop to the floor and skitter toward you. 

The cave fishers have nested their spawn in a broken crate. The vigilant parents watch hidden from a rocky ledge above. 

**9A. Storage Room:** Two cave fisher anglers perch on the 20-foot-high ledge overlooking the room. The chests and crates are remnants of the original mining operation. The kobolds have already stripped out the valuable items. The characters can still find many common items such as blankets, picks, shovels, coils of rope, and candles. The containers against the walls are stacked in such a way that a character could run 15 feet (3 squares) up the wall before having to climb the 5 feet (1 square) to the lower ledge.

From the highest ledge, characters can see a back passageway that is not visible from the ground. The passage branches but eventually leads to Kerang’s lair.
