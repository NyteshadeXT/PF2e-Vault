You see the final days of Xor-Souf, a longdead githzerai. Xor-Souf had spent the last part of her life chasing a strange meteor streaking through the heavens toward the world. She knew the cosmic stone was an artifact of evil and seems to have feared it, but she was also drawn by the immense power she can sense. As she followed the rock’s path, she stayed ever vigilant for a sliver of the main mass to break away. She believed that she could harvest some of the meteor’s power from such a shard without succumbing to its evil.

When the meteor made landfall, a fragment did break away to embed itself in the ground not far from the main impact site. The next-to-last memory stored within the crystal is of Xor-Souf landing her planar vessel near the Chaos Scar and leaving it to excavate the shard.

The crystal’s last entry is a disjointed and confusing jumble of emotions and thoughts. Some of them are Xor-Souf’s, but others came from an indescribable being wielding potent psionic power. The telepathic voice raged that Xor-Souf was and unsuitable vessel for its gift. It called out to Casaubon by name to come to the Chaos Scar, find the sliver, and claim true power.
