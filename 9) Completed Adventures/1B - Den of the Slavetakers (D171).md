# Adventure Hooks

1. A Family Kidnapping

1. Four members of Jangi Blackstream’s family were kidnapped last week, in two separate incidents. Jangi, a halfling trader who operates near the valley, is desperate to recover his kin: Nebin, Wayan, Shaena, and Lani. Survivors of one of the kidnappings, which turned into a short and almost lethal brawl, reported that the Blackstream cousins were taken by flying blue demons and a one-armed gnoll. Jangi has no solid information on what has happened to his relatives, but he has a nasty hunch. Some years ago, another family member discarded her old name (Nedda Blackstream), renamed herself Morgana, and moved into the Chaos Scar, if such a thing can be believed. Jangi thinks that Nedda/Morgana’s vindictive streak might explain an otherwise inexplicable assault on the Blackstream family, and he knows she is somewhere in the area of the valley that contains the temple. Jangi will pay 50 gp and provide a 25% discount on two 1st- through 5th-level magic items if the PCs can follow-up on his hunch.
2. Quest XP: 100 XP for finding Morgana, 100 XP for finding the missing Blackstreams, and another 300 XP for rescuing one or more halflings alive.

1. Smite the King that Crawls

1. It’s said that a cult devoted to Torog operates somewhere in the valley near the King’s Wall. A nearby temple of Avandra has never been able to cope with the worst problems presented by the Chaos Scar, but it certainly understands how to deal with Torog. The temple announces that it will pay anyone who can find and eliminate the temple 300 gp. As a start, Avandra’s followers point the heroes toward the area in which the Hand of Torog operates.
2. Quest XP: 50 XP for finding the temple, another 250 XP for erasing the temple from existence, and 200 XP for making sure that none of its priests or servants escape.
