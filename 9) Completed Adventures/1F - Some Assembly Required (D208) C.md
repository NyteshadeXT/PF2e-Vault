# Background
Over a hundred years ago, a red dragon came to the Nentir Vale to claim the territory as his own. The dragon was known as Kerang, and he was fearsome to behold. Kerang demanded tribute from the surrounding lands, razed farms, and gorged himself on livestock until the frightened populace gave in to his demands. Tales of Kerang spread from tavern to tavern. Champions came to challenge the red dragon, but Kerang dispatched them with ease. Then the druid Merlius Karnblack arrived. Merlius knew Kerang would never be taken by force alone. The clever druid watched the dragon for months until he was ready to launch his plan. 

Merlius concocted a potent sleeping potion that would cause the drinker to slumber for a hundred years. A sealed vial of the bitter mixture was sewn up inside of Kerang’s tribute of livestock. 

The dragon consumed his tribute the next day. Within hours, Kerang felt the potion taking effect. He rushed to the safety of his lair in what is now known as the Chaos Scar, but it was too late. The dragon thrashed wildly as he began to lose consciousness. Merlius sent the signal, and workers from the nearby mine brought the entire cave down on their tormentor. 

So ended the reign of Kerang. That might have been the end of his story had it not been for his faithful kobold wyrmpriest, Birk. Long after the rest of the tribe had fled, Birk pined for the master he had failed. The wyrmpriest clawed a tunnel into the dragon’s tomb and recovered Kerang’s brain. He sought out a necromancer to coax Kerang’s brain back to life,but it was all for naught. The magic-induced coma kept the dragon silent, even in undeath. Preserved in a jar, the brain was passed from generation to generation as an object of worship. 

After a hundred years had passed, Kerang awoke in horror. He vowed to reclaim his territory and utterly destroy the descendants of those who brought him so low. With the help of the kobold tribes he now holds in thrall, Kerang is excavating his bones and creating a new body, a massive construct.

# Running the Adventure
## Rests 
As the player characters venture deeper into the mine, taking rests becomes more problematic. Short rests should be uneventful, but the adventurers need to take precautions before an extended rest. More than one extended rest also forfeits the effects the party receives from successful completion of the “Hot on the Trail” encounter. In addition, the kobolds might have time to reinforce their positions. Use your best judgment when resetting traps and encounters.

## Kobolds 
The kobolds have trained giant rats, which they use in battle and sometimes as mounts. Try playing up the humorous side of the kobolds. They would be downright comical if it weren’t for their malevolence. Kobold patrols travel in and out of the mine, delivering fresh supplies. If you need one, a patrol consists of

[[Kobold-Scout|Kobold Scout]]
[[Giant-Rat|Giant Rat]]

```encounter-table
name: Kobold Patrol 1
creatures:
 - 3: Kobold Scout

name: Kobold Patrol 2
creatures:

 - Giant Rat

```

## Hot on the Trail (Skill Challenge)
### Clue 1: Kevmar's Body

If the party investigates the body:

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The guard leads you to a field on the outskirts of the keep where you find [[Kendon Longstrider - Baliff|Kendon]] already waiting for you.  There is a small body lying under at tarp.  Upon investigation you see that the corpse is covered in puncture wounds on the front and back.

-   [[skills#Medicine|Medicine]] (DC 10): Kevmar’s wounds are the result of piercing weapons, most likely spears or javelins.
-   [[skills#Perception|Perception]] (DC 15): The angle of the wounds suggests the attackers were small of stature.

### Clue 2: Witnesses

This clue can take place immediately after clue 1 or anytime while the adventurers are asking around the keep. Eyewitness testimony is notoriously unreliable. The witness in this case embellishes the story. When the adventurers are ready, read:

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
>A plump farmer steps forward, claiming to have seen one of the monsters.

-   [[skills#Deception|Deception]] (DC 15): The peasants are not used to being addressed with deference. The witness eagerly offers the following not-entirely-reliable information: “Looked like lil’ dragons, they did. Carried off me favorite sheep.”
-  [[skills#Intimidation|Intimidation]] (DC 15): The villagers are wary of ruffians and slick talkers. The witness backpedals from having seen the creatures very well. It was dark and they were in shadow. The beasts were small and reptilian, and they made yipping noises when they spoke.

### Clue 3: Burglarized Shed

The burglarized shed is located near the field where Kevmar's corpse is found. A trail of dropped nails leads from the shed to clue 4.

When the adventurers are ready, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
>A large woman in a sun hat waves to get your attention. “One of my sheds was broke into a few nights ago. No one’s gone inside since. I can take you there, if you like.”

-  [[skills#Perception|Perception]] (Rogue Only DC 10): The theft is the work of amateurs. They obviously came in through the unlocked window above the workbench. The thieves would have to be small to fit through the window.
-  [[skills#Perception|Perception]] (All Others DC 15): The character realizes that searching around the outside of the shed might be a good idea. The search turns up a purple crystal. A trail of dropped nails leads to clue 4.

### Clue 4: Footprints

This clue is found in a grassy field on the edge of town. The party can discover it by following the trail of dropped nails from the burglarized shed.

When the adventurers are ready, read:

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The glint of metal attracts your eye to a patch of tall grass near. Among the reeds, you spot a dagger crusted in dried blood. Several sets of clawed feet have left impressions in the soft earth. A trail of footprints leads north but quickly fades away.

-  [[skills#Perception|Perception]] (DC 15): The footprints wind through a cornfield. Every twenty or thirty feet, dried blood spatters can be spotted on the ground or terrain. After the trail reaches a small thicket of trees, it turns west, toward the King's Wall. A dead kobold is slumped against a nearby tree, clutching at a wound in its chest. A rolled sheet of paper in its pocket shows a technical drawing of a wing made of canvas. Scribbled measurements show that the wing is over ten feet long.
-  [[skills#Nature|Nature]] (DC 15): A search of the corpse reveals rock dust under the fingernails and toe claws, possibly from a mine or cave. The drawing of the wing is also discovered (if it hasn’t already been found).

### Clue 5: Sigil of Kerang

This clue can be found after following the kobold footprints or searching farther outside the keep. The sigil is carved into a tree.

When the adventurers are ready, read:

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> You spot a crude emblem cut into a gnarled oak. Judging from the dripping sap, the carving was recently engraved. The emblem depicts a haloed dragon.

-  [[skills#Society|Society]] (DC 15): The symbol has local historical importance to some of the villagers. If the check result is 19 or higher, the character immediately recalls the terrible tale of Kerang the Red Dragon, slain over a hundred years ago in the mountains nearby (see the “Background” section).
-  [[skills#Religion|Religion]] (DC 15): Humanoid species often carve symbols into trees to mark territory for their gods. The halo shows that this symbol holds a religious connotation.

### Success or Failure

The characters succeed if they decipher three or more clues. Otherwise, they fail. 

**Success:** The adventurers have won a small victory against Kerang. Award each character 5 XP per successfully deciphered clue. Quickly discovering the source of the kobold incursions allows the party to reach Kerang’s lair before his new body is completed. See the “Development” section of encounter 10. 

[[Kendon Longstrider - Baliff|Kendon]] can answer any questions the characters have while they are in town. The rock dust and purple crystal shards most likely came from an abandoned mine half a day’s travel to the west, beyond the King's Wall. If needed, [[Kendon Longstrider - Baliff|Kendon]] can draw the party a rough map to the location. 

**Failure:** The characters’ inaction or bungling has caused them to lose precious time. Night falls and one of the farmhouses is set on fire, mortally wounding a farmhand. Before he dies, he tells the adventurers that he was attacked by kobolds, and he identifies the direction in which they fled. If the party sets out in pursuit, a kobold patrol springs an ambush (see [[8) Adventures/1J - The Kobold Hall (DMG)/01) Running the Adventure#Kobolds|Kobolds]] under [[8) Adventures/1J - The Kobold Hall (DMG)/01) Running the Adventure]]). Any of the kobolds can tell the adventurers where the mine is. If all members of the patrol die, at least one kobold has a purple crystal, which [[Kendon Longstrider - Baliff|Kendon]] can identify for the characters, sending the party to the old mine.

## The Mine
![[Pasted image 20230305122457.png|340]] ![[Pasted image 20230307191305.png|340]]

Kerang and his kobold cohorts have taken up residence in a decrepit mine in the Briar Hills. The kobolds have retrofitted the mine with deadly traps and secret passageways. If captured or fleeing, they do their best to steer intruders into the hazards. The traps below show up at several keyed locations on the map. Disabling a trap at one location does not automatically disable it at all locations. The party must deal with the threats individually.

### T1. Tripwire Trap 
A tripwire is set 3.5 feet off the ground. Small creatures, such as halflings, gnomes, and kobolds, can pass underneath. The tripwire is made of woven spider silk and is difficult to detect.

### Tripwire *Hazard 0*  
[mechanical](../3)%20Rules/traits/mechanical.md)  [trap](../3)%20Rules/traits/trap.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 18 (or 0 if the trapdoor is disabled or [broken](../3)%20Rules/conditions.md#Broken))  

A nearly invisible wire is strung in your path.

- **Disable** [Thievery](../2)%20Compendium/skills.md#Thievery) DC 12 to remove safely disable the tripwire.  

- **AC** 10 , **Fort** +1, **Ref** +1
- **Immunities** critical hits; object immunities; precision damage
- **Resistances** 
- **Weaknesses** 
- - **Trigger**  A medium or larger creatures creature walks through the wire.
- - **Effect** Roll `dice: 1d4` to select an effect. Once triggered, the trap is disabled until reset. 
	1. Bag of Hammers *⬲{ .Pathfinder }* (attack): +8; 1d6 + 3 damage. 
	2. Warning Sound: Pots and pans make a racket as they fall to the ground. A kobold patrol (see [[8) Adventures/1J - The Kobold Hall (DMG)/01) Running the Adventure#Kobolds]]) comes to investigate. 
	3. Hair-Triggered Crossbow *⬲{ .Pathfinder }* (attack):  Ranged 5 (one creature); +6; 1d8 + 3 damage. 
	4. Swinging Spike s *⬲{ .Pathfinder }* (attack): Melee (one creature); +6; 1d8 + 4 damage.

**Reset** The tripwire must be reset manually for the trap to become [hidden](../3)%20Rules/conditions.md#Hidden) again.  

### T2. Covered Pit 
A flimsy board is covered in dirt and placed over a shallow spiked pit. Small creatures can run across the board, but the weight of larger creatures breaks it in half.

[[hidden-pit|Hidden Pit]]

### T3. Small Tunnels 
The kobolds have added tunnels to the mine that better suit them. The tunnels are built to scale for Small creatures. Medium or larger creatures need to squeeze and travel in single file to crawl through the passages.

### Captured! 
Kerang, the kobolds’ dragon master, is eager to lord his power over defeated foes. His minions deliver unconscious characters to Kerang’s lair, where they are stripped of all weapons and implements and locked in a large cage. The dragon-brain-in-a-jar harangues the adventurers about his plan to destroy the descendants of his enemies. 

Although Kerang never sleeps and his workers constantly move through the lair, captured characters might be able to slip away. [[6) NPCs/Restwell Keep/Zeta Windsnap]] could sneak out of her cell and create a diversion to help the party escape. If a character has thieves’ tools or a thin piece of metal, the lock on the cage can be picked with a DC 18 [[skills#Thievery|Thievery]] check. The door could also be smashed open with a DC 20 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics] check. The adventurers’ weapons are in plain sight atop Kerang’s hoard beside his altar. 

Once the construction of his body is complete, Kerang blasts through the rock wall to escape. The dragon launches into the air while clutching the cage in his iron talons. He immediately heads for Restwell Keep. Kerang drops the cage on a hilltop facing the keep and razes it to the ground. This situation is the characters’ last chance to escape. Refer to the “Concluding the Adventure” section for further information.

# Encounter 1 - The Mine Entrance
The mine entrance is guarded by a stout wooden door and is barred from the inside. Murder holes have been chiseled into the walls on each side of the door. 

**Light:** Bright (sunlight or lanterns). 

[[Kobold-Warrior|Kobold Warrior Minion]]
[[Kobold-Scout|Kobold Scout]]
[[Giant-Rat|Giant Rat]]

```encounter
name: Mine Entrance Encounter

creatures:
 - 8: Kobold Minion, 1, 15, 8
 - 2: Kobold Scout
 - Giant Rat

---
```

When the party can see the area, read: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A pair of rusted iron rails leads to a cavity cut into the mountainside and disappears behind a heavy wooden door. The opening is buttressed with heavy wooden beams. Many small openings are cut into the rock on either side of the door. 

[[skills#Perception|Perception]] DC 19: Light reflects off small pairs of eyes peering through openings in the rock. 

If a character looks for another entrance, read: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Directly above the mine entrance, high on the steep rock wall, two metal pipes jut into the air. Corroded metal grates cover the openings.

If the party waits stealthily, the characters see kobold groups enter and exit the mine every few hours from dusk until dawn. The groups use the passphrase “Ha eltak Kerang” (“Hail Kerang” in Draconic) to enter. 

**1A. Entrance:** Iron rails lead through this room and deeper into the tunnels. Refuse litters the floor here. The kobolds have fortified this antechamber with a barred door (Hardness 10, HP 40, BT 20);. Breaking the door open requires a successful DC 25 [[../../rules/actions/force-open|Force Open]]-Athletics checks. The door can be unbarred from inside the room. Murder holes have been cut into the rock around the door. 

**1B. Ventilation Shaft:** Fifty feet above the entrance on a steep rock wall ([[../../rules/actions/climb|Climb]]-Athletics DC 15 to climb), two large ventilation pipes are visible. Metal grates cover the shafts, but the locks are brittle and oxidized ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] DC 12 to break or [[skills#Thievery|Thievery]] DC 12 to pick). Inside, the shafts have maintenance ladders. Sound is amplified, so a DC 10 [[skills#Stealth|Stealth]] check is required to avoid attracting attention. The shafts open just behind the mine entrance.

## Tactics
The kobolds guarding the mine entrance are vigilant. They keep the door barred unless a kobold patrol is passing through. Unless directly targeted by attacks, the guards hide at the murder holes and wait to attack until their enemies approach the door. The last kobold standing flees. 

## Development 
The mine entrance is far enough from the kobold base of operations that the din of battle attracts no attention from other kobolds. If any kobolds flee, they head for the mine carts and try to reach the others.

# Encounter 2 - Mine Carts
The mine carts stored in this area can be used to travel quickly to the deep mine. If a kobold fled in the last encounter, the characters catch a glimpse of it making a getaway in a mine cart. 

**Light:** Dim light (luminescent crystals).

As the characters enter 2A, read: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The iron tracks fork here and continue in parallel into a long tunnel. A weathered plaque over the tunnel reads “Deep Mine this way.” Dimly glowing purple crystals have been set into the tunnel walls at regular intervals. A pair of mine carts sits on a side track. A metal door is slightly ajar on the south wall. 

**2A. Cart Storage:** Mine carts are stored in the area when not in use. The carts are constructed of thick iron reinforced with riveted steel bands. 

**2B. Repair Room:** A few lengths of iron rail and a mine cart without wheels shows that this room is probably used for maintenance tasks. A search turns up mundane items (roll three times on the Mundane Items table) and a ten-foot wooden pole. 

**2C. Tunnel to Deep Mine:** At the halfway point to the deep mine, kobolds attack the party. Area 2C on the map is an abstraction of a long, descending tunnel that accommodates the mine chase, as described in the “Mine Chase” section below.

When the kobolds attack, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Suddenly, you hear the piercing squeal of metal on metal from a side tunnel. Four mine carts full of kobolds explode onto the track in a shower of sparks.

## Mine Chase 
This moving cart battle happens in a part of the mine where the tracks diverge into three sections. The characters start in the center of track 2 with kobolds on each side. The kobolds ride in four carts, each cart holding one kobold slinger and two kobold tunnelers. 

[[Kobold-Warrior|Kobold Warrior Minion]]
[[Kobold-Scout|Kobold Scout]]

```encounter
name: Mine Enterance Encounter
creatures:
 - 2: Kobold Minion, 1, 15, 8
 - Kobold Scout
```

**Setup:** To begin the encounter, place one mine cart of kobolds in the start area on track 1 and another on track 3. When all kobolds in a cart are killed, remove the cart and add another with the same initiative on a random track at the start of the next round. Repeat until all four carts of kobolds have been destroyed. If the characters were pursuing a fleeing kobold, be sure to place it in a mine cart on the track ahead of them. 

**Mine Carts:** Large crystals fixed to the front and back give off bright light when the cart is in motion. Each cart measures almost 10 feet square and can accommodate four passengers. The carts roll easily on the tracks and pick up speed quickly in the downward sloping tunnel. The carts have no controls other than simple hand brakes on the fore and aft. A cart offers cover to standing creatures and superior cover to prone creatures. 

**Moving:** The mine carts move at a speed of 6 when rolling downhill. Any combatant in a cart can take a move action to use the following mine cart terrain powers. For the purpose of triggering any attack, moving a mine cart is considered to be forced movement.

> [!note]+ Call Out
> **Move Actions**
> *Shift Weight*
> Requirement: The creature must be in one of the affected mine cart’s squares. 
> Effect: The mine cart moves forward 1 square on its track. All creatures in the mine cart move with the terrain. 
> 
> *Apply Brakes*
> Requirement: The creature must be in one of the affected mine cart’s squares. 
> Effect: The mine cart moves back 1 square on its track. All creatures in the mine cart move with the terrain

When running this encounter, assume that the mine carts are moving at a constant speed of 6. Rather than moving the carts 6 squares forward every round plus any terrain power movement, track the relative positions of objects on the battlefield. To stay in the fight, a creature on the ground must keep pace with the carts. 

**Battle Events:** At the end of every round, roll a random effect on the Mine Chase Events table. The mine carts cannot change tracks unless indicated by a random event.

| 6            | A kobold quickblade riding a giant weasel enters the battle. Reroll if this random event has already occurred.                                                                       |
| 7            | Elevation: Until the end of the next round, a random track is elevated by 10 feet.                                                                                                   |

| 10             | Hard right: All mine carts move one track down if unoccupied space is available.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Travel by Foot 
Traveling to the deep mine by foot takes roughly ninety minutes. If the characters take the time to explore every side tunnel turnout, they encounter the kobolds at the turnout closest to area 2C. Run the encounter on foot. 

If the party marches past the turnout without stopping to explore it, invite the players to roll initiative and place their characters anywhere on the leftmost portion of the map. On the kobolds’ initiative count, their mine carts rush down tracks 1 and 3 and screech to a halt at the rightmost portion of the encounter map. All characters standing on a square in track 1 or 3 must succeed on an [[skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check (DC 19) or take `dice: 1d10+4` damage. Those whose check result is 15 or lower also fall prone. 

## Conclusion 
After the encounter, the rest of the trip to the deep mine is uneventful. The tracks lead to the deep mine checkpoint at area 3A.

![[Pasted image 20230305152318.png]]

# Encounter 3 - Deep Mine Checkpoint
The first area of the deep mine contains a checkpoint and a storeroom. 
**Light:** Dim light (luminescent crystals). 

When the party approaches 3A, read: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A barricade of timber and spikes has been set up on the track, blocking mine carts from moving farther. Two side tracks accommodate another mine cart and a handcar. 

**3A. Guard Post:** A spare mine cart and a handcar are located on a side track here. The handcar, operated by two people, can be used to haul up to two mine carts at a time back to the mine entrance. A crude barricade blocks further passage by mine cart. 

**3B. Chutes and Rock Piles:** Behind two 3-foothigh rock piles lurk the kobolds ([[skills#Perception|Perception]] DC 18 to spot the creatures). If they are not spotted, the kobolds gain a surprise round. 

[[Kobold-Warrior|Kobold Warrior]]
[[Kobold-Dragon-Mage|Kobold Dragon Mage]]

```encounter
name: Deep Mine Checkpoint
creatures:
 - 3: Kobold Warrior
 - 2: Kobold Dragon Mage
```

Directly in front of the rock piles are two limestone chutes, each one covered by a stretched tarp and dirt ([[skills#Perception|Perception]] DC 18 to detect). Any creature stepping on a chute’s square must make a saving throw; success means the creature falls prone in the square it left to step into the chute, and failure means a fall into the chute. The creature can attempt a DC 12 [[grab-an-edge|Grab an Edge]] check to arrest the fall and climb back out of the chute (also a move action). A creature that fails to do so falls to area 8B. 

**3C. Crystal Pool:** Purple crystals line the walls around this pool. Some of the larger crystals can be broken off and use as light sources. Once harvested in this manner, a crystal gives off dim purple light for three months. 

**3D. Storeroom:** The many shelves in this chamber suggest that it was once a storeroom, but almost all the supplies have long since disappeared. Roll three times on the Mundane Items table. 

**3E. Storage Closet:** This enormous closet is filled with trash and empty crates.

# Encounter 4 - Rat Pen
The kobolds keep their weasels in a large cage when not on patrol. 

**Light:** Bright light (torches). 

When the characters enter the room, read: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Whips, leashes, and bridles hang on the wall in this large chamber. Enormous rats sniff at the air behind a 15-foot-high makeshift pen. Two kobolds are here. 

The rats cannot leave the pen unless someone opens the gate. Each quickblade starts 6 squares from the gate. If the pen is closed, a quickblade rushes over on its turn and opens the gate as a minor action. The rats then fight alongside the kobolds

# Encounter 5 - Collapsed Mine
In the long-forgotten calamity that befell this mine, the passages to this section collapsed. Many miners were trapped here and live on in undead misery. 
**Light:** None.  

When the characters enter 5A, read: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A rickety wooden elevator platform occupies this room. Rusted iron rungs are anchored into the rock wall, allowing passage to the shaft below. The air is stuffy and full of dust. 
> 
> [[skills#Perception|Perception]] DC 15: A human figure struggles under a fallen support beam to the south. 

When the characters approach 5B, read: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A zombified human corpse in tattered robes is pinned beneath a heavy wooden beam that fell from the ceiling. It hisses and flails around, trying to grab your legs. The creature must have been trapped here for decades. Deep grooves have been carved into the rock floor, and the fingers on the creature’s hands have been worn to nubs as it tried to free itself. A wand and purse are cinched to its leather belt. 

When the zombies emerge from 5C, read: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Moaning wails and the sounds of shuffling feet break the stillness. A throng of restless undead shambles into view. 

**5A. Upper Mine Elevator:** Rusted iron rails lead to an elevator platform. Presumably, mine carts were once raised and lowered here, but it’s questionable whether the platform could support such weight now. The elevator mechanism is still functional, but excessive weight could cause it to break, dumping its occupants into the 40-foot-deep shaft below. Iron rungs in the wall lead down to area 5E. 

**5B. Fallen Foreman:** This passageway is unremarkable except for a solitary zombie trapped beneath a support beam on the floor. The poor soul was once the mine’s foreman. The zombie is considered to be helpless. Noise in this area attracts the attention of the zombies in area 5C. 

Treasure: At his waist, the zombie foreman carries a wand of digging and a purse containing 27 sp and dried figs. The wand of digging is a metal wand tipped with a tiny shovel head. The wand can be used once per day to blast through two 5-foot squares of natural rock. The accompanying explosion can be heard up to 50 squares away. 

5C. Ore Deposit: Undead are often drawn to mindlessly carry out the tasks they performed while living. The zombie miners mill around a rich vein of silver ore. There are several high-purity silver deposits on the rock surface. A character with a mining pick could break off five chunks worth 10 gp each. The zombies shamble toward any loud noise in the collapsed mine area.

5D. Cave-In: The ceiling has collapsed in this area. It would take five workers an hour to clear a 5-foot square of debris.

5E. Lower Mine Elevator: Two sets of iron rails converge on a square of recessed floor under a tall shaft. Metal rungs are set in the rock wall. A pictograph is painted low on the wall in white paint. It shows an arrow pointing up next to a skull and crossbones.

# Encounter 6 - Barracks
Supply rooms in this area are used as a barracks. 
**Light:** Bright light (oil lanterns). 

**6A. Main Barracks:** [[skills#Perception|Perception]] DC 8: You hear loud yipping voices in an argument behind the door. Two wyrmpriests argue over who gets to bunk closest to Jiro, the kobold wild mage favored by Kerang. They are surrounded by a few onlookers (one dragonshield and two tunnelers). Jiro’s quarters are separated behind a filthy curtain. The kobold wild mage is spending all his time in Kerang’s chamber now. If combat breaks out, the six tunnelers in area 6B awake and join the fray.

**6B. Bedding Chamber:** This room contains six sleeping kobold tunnelers. 

```encounter

```

**6C. Treasure Room:** The kobolds refer to this area as their “treasure room.” An unlocked wooden chest contains one treasure (DM’s discretion).

# Encounter 7 - Holding Cell
The kobolds have converted this former office into a prison cell. The sole occupant is Zeta Windsnap, the missing girl from Dardun. 
Light: Bright light (oil lantern). 

When the characters come near the door, read: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A door with a horizontal slot cut into the center is set into a small alcove ahead. The door is wrapped with a thick chain and locked with a heavy padlock. Suddenly, a frail human hand shoots out through the slot, reaching for you. In a desperate whisper, a young girl’s voice says, “Help me! Quick! Please!” 

**The Cell Door:** The lock on the door is a good one ([[skills#Thievery|Thievery]] DC 20 to open), and the door is made of thick wood (Hardness 10, HP 40, BT 20). Breaking the door open requires a successful DC 24 [[../../rules/actions/force-open|Force Open]]-Athletics checks. The sound of smashing the door attracts two kobold patrols. 

Zeta knows the guards have a key, and they most recently went somewhere to the south. The kobold wild mage, Jiro, currently holds the key in area 10. 

**The Missing Girl:** Zeta Windsnap is hungry and bruised but in good health. She answers any of the party’s questions that she can. See the “Lore” section below. 

If freed, the plucky girl asks for a dagger or short sword. The kid’s got heart, but she’s no warrior. In combat, treat her as a minion (defenses 10; hp 1). If told to return home, she reluctantly leaves the group, but she hides in the woods and rejoins the characters when they emerge from the mine. 

**Lore:** Zeta’s brother Kevmar went out alone in search of the night beasts. She followed him and hid in the bushes. When the kobolds attacked Kevmar, she leaped forward and stabbed one of the creatures in the chest, mortally wounding it. The kobolds cut her brother down and beat her severely. That’s when she lost consciousness. 

When Zeta awoke, she was in a large cavern. Kobolds were everywhere, building a machine bigger than a house. She saw a robed kobold shouting from a pedestal next to a jar almost as big as he was, but she couldn’t understand what he was saying. They dragged her to this room, where she’s been ever since. The kobolds have not fed her.

# Encounter 8 - Slime Pool
This section of the mine has become flooded after years of neglect. A green slime has taken up residence in the murky waters at the crossroads. The kobolds never visit this cave. 
**Light:** None. 

When the characters approach the area, read: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The passageway follows a gradual decline and eventually becomes submerged. From the edge of the water, you can see the passage levels out and continues, but the murkiness prevents you from seeing how far it goes. 

**8A. Submerged Passage:** The green slime lies in wait under the water’s surface ten feet down the submerged passage. If the party lingers at the water’s edge for too long, the slime rushes at the combatant closest to the edge. Otherwise, it waits for victims to come to it. 

[[Gray-Ooze|Gray Ooze]]

```encounter
name: Slime Pool
creatures:
 - Gray Ooze
```

**8B. Bone Pit:** Anyone who falls down a chute in area 3B drops from a hole in the ceiling into a pile of bones, taking `dice: 2d6` damage. The bone pile fills the southern half of the cave.

# Encounter 9 - Cave Fisher Lair
The high ceiling in this naturally cut cavern once made the room an ideal storage area. Now that cave fishers have taken up residence here, the kobolds avoid this chamber. 
**Light:** None. 

When the characters enter 9A, read: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Two wide ledges—one 20 feet high, the other 40 feet high— hug the walls of this tall cave. Dusty chests and wooden containers line the walls, stacked toward the high ceiling. At the far end of the room, the top half of a large crate has been wrenched off. 

When the characters come close to 9B, read: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The hay and loose packing material stuffed in the broken crate begin to move. Several pink creatures emerge, chittering as they flop to the floor and skitter toward you. 

The cave fishers have nested their spawn in a broken crate. The vigilant parents watch hidden from a rocky ledge above. 

**9A. Storage Room:** Two cave fisher anglers perch on the 20-foot-high ledge overlooking the room. The chests and crates are remnants of the original mining operation. The kobolds have already stripped out the valuable items. The characters can still find many common items such as blankets, picks, shovels, coils of rope, and candles. The containers against the walls are stacked in such a way that a character could run 15 feet (3 squares) up the wall before having to climb the 5 feet (1 square) to the lower ledge.

**9B. Crate Nest:** The cave fisher spawn are located in a crate here. Under hay and broken eggshells, the cave fishers have crammed a kobold corpse as fodder.

```encounter
name: Cave Fisher Babies
creatures:
 - 4: Cave Fisher, 1, 18, 7
```

From the highest ledge, characters can see a back passageway that is not visible from the ground. The passage branches but eventually leads to Kerang’s lair.

# Encounter 10 - Kerang's Lair
After more than a century in hibernation, Kerang is frantic to be free of his glass prison—the embalming jar that houses his brain. 
**Light:** Bright (oil lanterns). 

Monsters: Kerang (kobold dragon construct), Jiro (kobold wild mage), 2 kobold dragonshields, 10 kobold tunnelers. 

When the characters can see the area, read: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The passage widens into a gigantic rock cavern filled with scaffolding and stacks of construction materials. An enormous dragon sculpture dominates the center of the room. The sculpture is a mishmash of dragon bone and metal plates, held together with bailing wire, struts, and leather bindings. A huge pair of canvas wings is drawn in close to its back. A cracked dragon skull adorns the top of a long neck studded with metal spikes. 
> 
> A robed kobold barks orders as a team of kobolds lowers a giant glass jar filled with murky water into a hatch on the dragon sculpture. You see something fat and pale gurgling just below the water’s surface as the hatch snaps shut. 

When the characters enter battle, read: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The robed kobold spies you and screams (in Draconic), “Intruders! Master, protect us!” The sculpture springs to life. Canvas wings suddenly spread open with a sound like a cracking whip, sending out a gust of wind that knocks several kobolds from their scaffolds. 
> 
> The dragon construct rears up on its hind legs with a roar that shakes the chamber. “WHO DARES DISTURB KERANG?” A cotter pin shoots from its mooring and makes a pinging sound as it rebounds off the cave wall. The beast’s forearms crash back to the earth, squashing a slow moving kobold to a red pulp. 

If the characters succeeded in the “Hot on the Trail” encounter, add: 

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A large metal breastplate falls from the construct and clatters to the floor, revealing an empty cavity and a detached hose. You have apparently arrived before Kerang’s construction was complete.

Kerang’s new body stands at the center of the chamber, surrounding by rickety scaffolding. The dragon’s trusted follower, Jiro, stands next to the altar, delivering Kerang’s orders to the workers. 

> [!warning]
> If the adventurers were successful in the “Hot on the Trail” encounter, Kerang’s breath weapon does not recharge, and only the effect of fiery explosion works. Other than Jiro, the dragon cares little for his minions. Jiro and the other kobolds fight to protect their master to their last breath.

# Concluding the Adventure
Once the adventurers have defeated Kerang, any kobolds remaining in the mine slink away into the countryside. Jiro has a key that can be used to unlock  [[6) NPCs/Restwell Keep/Zeta Windsnap]]'s cell. If the characters released her earlier, she is hiding in the bushes outside the mine, waiting to go with the party back to Restwell Keep. 

If the characters were captured by Kerang and later escaped, the kobolds continue to fortify the mine and hold [[6) NPCs/Restwell Keep/Zeta Windsnap]] captive.  

Should the adventurers decide not to pursue Kerang at all, the dragon arrives at Restwell Keep four days later and razes it to the ground. He continues to fortify his stronghold while launching attacks against the surrounding lands.
