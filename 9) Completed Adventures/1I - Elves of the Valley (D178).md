# Adventure Hooks

1. Rescue Mission

1. A character’s mentor, sibling, friend, or loved one was swept up in an attack and has now gone missing. As there is no one else with the wherewithal to rescue the abducted, it falls to the party to undertake the mission. Alternatively, you can easily turn this into a revenge scenario by having the NPC killed rather than taken. Any prisoners the raiders take can be recovered in the “Eyes in the Forest” encounter.
2. Minor Quest XP: 125 XP

1. A Second Mission

1. By defeating the Brothers Gray the PCs have come to the attention of a noble in a nearby barony. After the heroes’ success against these renegades, the noble funds their expedition to wipe out these ruthless killers.
2. Minor Quest XP: 100 XP plus 200 gp

1. Happenstance

1. While on the way to or from another expedition into the Chaos Scar, the characters run afoul of the ambush. Perhaps one of the blackleaf snipers steals something from the characters and flees into the woods, or maybe the adventurers simply recognize the threat these killers pose.
2. Minor Quest XP: 100 XP

# Conversion Notes

## Enchanted Woods

Distances stretch, trails shift, trees move, rocks dance: Finding your way through this wood will not be easy.

Level: 1

Complexity: 2 (requires 6 successes before 3 failures)

Primary Skills: Acrobatics, Arcana, Athletics, Insight, Nature, Perception, Stealth, Survival, other

Special: The characters can attempt a maximum of two skill checks each hour, except in hour 3, which is a separate encounter that can earn them a success toward completing this skill challenge. But they can earn only a maximum of 1 success each hour. This means they have the option to make a second attempt in an hour if they fail at the first, but they still need 1 success each hour of their trip through the woods to successfully complete the skill challenge.

Hour 1: Arcana or Insight

Arcana, Insight (DC 15): The woods’ strange character reveals itself in haunting laughter and flitting shadows. The party makes a group skill check using Arcana (to perceive the magical effect) or Insight (to rely on instinct), with a success gained if at least half the PCs succeed on the check. If at least two characters succeed by 5 or more, the party gains a +2 bonus on skill checks made during the next hour. The characters can earn only one success, and a maximum of 1 success, in this hour during this skill challenge.

Hour 2: Acrobatics or Athletics

Acrobatics, Athletics (DC 10): Thorn bushes, bracken, and small trees block the party’s progress. The party makes a group skill check using Acrobatics (to wriggle through the tangles) or Athletics (to bull through the tangles), with a success gained if at least half the characters succeed on the check. In addition to counting as a failure, if half the party fails the check, every character gains one level of fatigue from injuries sustained in the hostile environment.

Hour 3: Other

Other: The party comes upon a bog in the forest. Proceed with Tactical Encounter 2: “Boggy Down,” see page 11. If the party defeats the enemies, they gain 1 success. If they retreat, they gain 1 failure.

Hour 4: Survival or Nature

Survival, Nature (DC 10): Bloodsucking midges attack the party. The characters make a group skill check using Survival or Nature (to use a balm or some other protection that repels the vermin), with a success gained if at least half the characters succeed. If half the characters fail, the characters take a –2 penalty on all skill checks made for the remainder of the encounter in addition to counting as a failure.

Hour 5: Perception

Perception (DC 15): Several paths through the woods reveal themselves to the party. The characters make a group skill check to find the tracks and identify false ones. The party gains a success if at least half the characters succeed.

Hour 6: Stealth

Stealth (DC 15): The adventurers close in on the heart of the woods. If they would approach undetected, they must be quiet. The characters make a group skill check with a success gained if at least half the party succeeds.

Success: The characters overcome the woods’ strange magic and proceed to Tactical Encounter 3: Voice in the Darkness (see page 13). The characters have surprise for this encounter.

Defeat: The characters are thoroughly confused by the wood’s strange magic. They proceed to Tactical Encounter 3, as above, but are themselves surprised.

## 1) Eyes in the Forest

This encounter includes the following creatures.

3 Elven scout (force ranged)

3 Wolf minions

1 Elven veteran archer leader (Phystal). 

Give all elves the Blackleaf Arrow ability as follows.

**Blackleaf Arrow**
Standard; requires bow; 3/encounter
The archer makes a bow attack.  On hit, the archer makes a secondary attack against the same target.
Secondary Attack: +3 vs Constitution; the target is stunned and takes ongoing 3 poison damage (save ends).

## Interrogating the Prisoners

To learn something from the prisoner, you must get past the defiance revealed in its soulless black eyes.

Level: 1 (100 XP)

Complexity: 1 (requires 4 successes before 3 failures).

Primary Skills: Arcana, Insight, Intimidate, Persuasion

Arcana (DC 15, 1 success, maximum 2 successes): The first successful check identifies the magical curse afflicting the prisoner as having an elemental origin. Success by 5 or more also grants the character a +2 bonus to the next Arcana check made. A second successful check lifts the curse. In addition to counting as a failure, a failed Arcana check also deals 5 psychic damage to the character that made the check.

Persuasion (DC 10, 1 success, requires 2 successes from Arcana, maximum 2 successes): The first successful check calms the prisoner. The second successful check helps the elf set aside the crushing guilt for the crimes he or she committed. Persuasion checks attempted before gaining the requisite number of Arcana checks result in automatic failures.

Insight (DC 10, 1 success, maximum 1 success): A successful check reveals the elf is ensorcelled and opens up the Arcana skill.

Intimidate (DC 17 or 5, 1 success, maximum 4 successes): Use the higher DC if the PCs have not yet accumulated 2 successes from Arcana. Each successful check breaks down the prisoner’s will.

Victory: The characters lift the enchantment corrupting the prisoner’s mind. The freed elf reveals, “There is evil in these woods, ancient and abominable. It whispers in the darkness, poisoning our minds with its vile words. Beware, friends, lest you succumb to the same corruption.” The elf warns the adventurers that others haunt the woods. All is not as it seems in the forest, and it’s easy to become turned around. The elf offers to lead the characters to the Voice in the Darkness, granting the characters a +2 bonus on any skill checks related to the “Enchanted Woods” skill challenge. However, the elf flees at the start of any combat encounter.

Defeat: The elf explodes in a burst of harmless, disgusting black filth.
