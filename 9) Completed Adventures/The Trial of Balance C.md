You find an old druid circle.  At it's center is an alter.  What do you do?

# Trial 1 - Obvious
Before you are three paths.  The right is well ordered.  There are brick's paving the path and each is perfectly placed.  The path is straight as far as the eye can see and the edges of the path well defined.  Even the foliage along the path appears neat and ordered   The left path is almost diametrically opposed.  The path almost immediately turns for no obvious reason.  As you follow it with your eye, it zig-zags and doubles back on itself sometimes making it impossible to know if you are going down the path or coming back.  At times it becomes very narrow almost impossible to discern a path even exists will at others it is arbitrarily wide.  Trees and grass grow over, around and even through the path in places.  The last path runs between the two, skirting on the orderly and the disorderly in an effort to get the traveler to their ultimate destination.  You hear a voice seeming to come from all around you and yet no where.  It says, "Balance should be found in all things.  Sometimes the choice is obvious.  Choose your path." 

Somewhere down the path will be a glowing fragment.  Purple for the chaotic path, blue for ordered path and white for the path between the two.

# Trial 2 - Good and Evil
As you pick up the fragment before you, you have a series of visions regarding the world in which you now find yourself.  At one time, a necromantic army coursed across the land destroying and killing where ever it went.  The last few remaining nations finally banded together and through their lot in with a higher being of goodness.  Champions of good blessed by the higher being brought their holy light to the war and quickly turned the tide.  As the visions fade you realize you are standing at the edge of a battleground.  The army of goodness and the last vestiges of the necromantic horde are locked in a stalemate.  Neither side seems to be able to gain the upper hand as you watch.  The voice from before speaks again, "Balance should be found in all things.  I give you the power to change the course of this battle and forever alter the fate of this world."  Suddenly you feel a rush of power and know you could destroy both armies with but a blink.  You also innately know how to unleash it's might on those before you.  "Sometimes the choices is hard.  What you choose to do next matters."

If you choose to help the army of goodness evil will be forever eradicated from this world.  You find a purple fragment at your feet.

If you choose to help the necromantic army or choose to do nothing, you leave this world or this battle depending on your choice at a stalemate.  You find a white fragment at your feet.

Chose to destroy both armies and you gain a blue fragment.

# Trial 3 - The Choice
You find yourself in a swamp.  There is a small path forward that is mostly dry.  Eventually you wander into a grassy clearing that is unlike the rest of the surrounding terrain.  A small clear stream runs through its center.  It is bright and beautiful flowers dot the landscape.  There are no signs of the swamp in this clearing.  Birds sing happily and the sun warms your face.  At the far edge of this clearing is a young satyr, a child.  The satyr is working with the surrounding terrain.  It then plays a short melody on a flute and before your eyes you see some of the swampy terrain transform.  A small oak begins to form where once there was a scraggly unidentifiable swamp tree.  The swamp water in the small area drains away.  Grass begins to grow and a few small flowers form.  The now familiar voice speaks, "Balance should be found in all things.  Sometimes you can't be sure of the right choice."

If you choose to help the satyr for a time, he will give you a blue fragment.

If you stop the child from completing his work, you will obtain a purple fragment.

Chose to do nothing and you gain a white fragment.

# Balance Matters 
An Arboreal Regent walk through the woods toward you.  As it does, the other plants seem to shift and move out of it's way creating a clear path.  You realize that you are lying on the alter in the druid circle and next to you are the three fragments you obtained.  

He will introduce himself as Wollom and proceed to have a conversation about what happened and what comes next.  Wollom will also help with the final step of using the fragments collected to either: 
1) (Mostly purple chaos fragments, be aware of the remaining color) Wollom seeks to bring balance to the chaos.  Purple light from the fragments envelops you.  You will retain the crystal shard wildshape bear form but it will no longer cause you pain or fatigue you to the point of passing out.  Wollom will explain that while he has been able to calm the chaos within you continued exposure will likely cause other unexpected and uncontrollable changes.
2) (Mostly blue law fragments, be aware of the remaining color)  Wollom will infuse your very being with order and law.  Your body is wracked with pain as the blue light envelops you.  The forces of law and chaos vie for dominance in the battlefield that is your very being.  The Staff of Earth will shatter into pieces unable to withstand the onslaught of power.  The Arboreal Regent will be truly shaken by this event and will immediately leave once it knows you are still alive.  You can feel the powers struggle with each other, like yin and yang.  You inherently know this is far from over...
3) (Mostly white fragments) Wollom helps to purge the the imbalance that chaos has wrought on your body.  As you are enveloped in a white light you begin to feel the chaos being drawn out of you.  It's an unsettling pulling sensation that seems to stem from your very soul.  You watch as the Staff of Earth crumbles into pieces, but the white light brightens and draws in the remaining pieces reshaping them into something new.  Vines from the surrounding forest snake toward you and merge with the light.  [[tempered-harmony-hb|Tempered Harmony]] is created.  With the chaos removed your wildshape ability returns to normal.
