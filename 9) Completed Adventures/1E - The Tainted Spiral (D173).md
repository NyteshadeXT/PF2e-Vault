# Adventure Hooks

1. Strange Lights

1. This hook can be used when the adventurers are already in the Chaos Scar. The PCs see a strange, bluish glow in the distance that looks like no light they have ever seen. As they travel closer to the source of the light, allow the heroes to make a DC 15 Arcana check to learn that the light is magical and extraplanar in nature, and can be tied to the Far Realm.

3. Missing Merchants

1. The PCs are approached by a young elven woman named Ardia Ironleaf. She is the daughter of Tarthias Ironleaf, the head of a small but profitable elven trading company that deals exclusively in fine, elven weapons. Tarthias has not returned from his last trading expedition, and tales of terrible, tentacled monsters attacking travelers has Ardia very worried, especially since Tarthias’ trade route takes him close to the King’s Wall. Ardia asks the PCs to find her father, and if her worst fears are true, to return his signet ring to her. She offers the PCs 100 gp and a 15% discount on any goods sold by the Ironleaf Trading Company if they can discover the fate of her father.

1. Quest XP: 250 XP for discovering the fate of Tarthias Ironleaf or 500 XP for returning his signet ring to Ardia.

6. The Chaos Connection

1. Ivian the Unpredictable is a notable sorcerer whose specializes in wild magic; he has sensed the energy given off by the warp crystals and has come to the conclusion that it is connected with the Far Realm. He believes that the energy is radiating from a location in the Chaos Scar and asks the PCs to investigate and discern the source of the energy. He offers 100 gp for the completion of this task. In addition, he will gladly pay another 50 gp for a sample of warp crystal if the PCs bring him some.

1. Quest XP: 250 XP for discovering the source of the chaos energy or 500 XP for returning a piece of the warp crystal to Ivian.

# Conversion Notes

## T1) Tunnel Trouble

Use this encounter only if the PCs fail the skill challenge in T3. Navigating the Tainted Spirl

Use one Fell Taint Lasher minion, one Fell Taint Pulsar minion and one Fell Taint Thought Eater

## T2) The Larder

Use three Fell Taint Lasher minions, one Fell Taint Pulsar

For the bodies roll one medium CR 1 lair.  Don't forget about the effects of the Warp Crystals.

## T3) Navigating the Tainted Spiral

The dungeon is comprised of three large caverns connected by a series of twisting, narrow tunnels that spiral deeper and deeper into the earth. The first cavern, encounter T2, is at the surface. The tunnels leading deeper into the spiral range from 5 to 15 feet wide and are dimly lit by small clusters of warp crystals. Navigating the tunnels can be both confusing and dangerous, and the heroes could easily become lost are be set upon by fell taints if they make a wrong turn. This skill challenge begins when the heroes enter the spiral after encounter T2, but is broken up by the combat encounters that follow. See Success, below, for details.

Level: 1 (XP 200)

Complexity: 1 (requires 4 successes before 3 failures).

Primary Skills: Arcana, Nature, Perception, Survival

Arcana (DC 10, 1 success): The character’s arcane training gives her some familiarity with the energies of the Far Realm, allowing her to detect the source and strength of the energy permeating these tunnels. A warlock who has the Great Old One as a patron gains a +2 bonus on this check.

Survival (DC 10, 1 success): A character’s familiarity with subterranean environments allows him to navigate the twisting tunnels. The adventurer detects the subtle downward-sloping grade of the narrow passages and knows that going deeper likely means going in the right direction. In addition, he can sense the dire energy of the Far Realm grow stronger as the party descends into the depths.

Perception (DC 10, 1 success, no maximum): A character might not know much about navigating underground, but his keen eyes and ears allow him to keep track of landmarks, ensuring that the party doesn’t wander in circles.

Nature (DC 10, 1 success): Although you are somewhat out of your element, your direction sense is good enough to aid underground navigation.

Other skills: (DC 15, 1 success): Players with good justification may use other skills to navigate the twisting, narrows tunnels to arrive safely at their destination.

Success: The PCs reach the next encounter area without incident. After the first 2 successes, the characters have successfully found their way through the first half of the tunnels. Proceed to encounter T4. After the next 2 successes, the characters have reached the heart of the spiral. Proceed to encounter T5.

Failure: After blundering around in the darkness for hours, the adventurers wind up back in the encounter area they just left. If they have yet to accumulate enough successes to reach the next encounter area, they lose any gained since that point. They do not lose successes they have accumulated prior to the previous encounter area. For example, if the characters accumulate 2 successes and reach encounter T4, then fail the skill challenge, they find themselves back in the cavern for encounter T4, and are still considered as having 2 successes that count toward overall success in the skill challenge. They lose any success they accumulated between encounters T2 and T3, however. In addition, the characters trigger encounter T1 if they fail, as they run afoul of a group of wandering fell taints. Regardless of how many times they fail the challenge, they only ever deal with encounter T1 once.

## T4) The Silent Stream

Use one Naiad, one fell taint pulsar and one fell taint thought eater.

Roll a small CR 1 lair for the two corpses in the water.

Don't forget about the effects of the Warp Crystals.

Note the treasure item in the module.

## T5) Cavern of the Shard

Use two fell taint lashers, one fell taint warp wender and shard golem as presented without the dual mind sear.
