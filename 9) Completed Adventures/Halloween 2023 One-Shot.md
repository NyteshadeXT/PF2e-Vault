# Background 
The Halloween Queen is drawn to the strange powers of the Chaos Scar each year on All Hollow's Eve.  Last season, she stumbled upon the PCs and found them to be interesting.  They handled her "trick" with relative ease which she has found to not be an easy feat for most.  She has decided to actively seek them out this season and whisk them into her realm of never ending Halloween for a new, more dangerous, trick.  She, of course, knows that with every good trick must come a good treat!

# Running the Adventure
**Total Adventure Value:**Â 
- [x] Total (205 XP)

**The Portal:** The queen will attempt to pull the players into her realm by temporarily changing an existing doorway or entrance into a portal to her realm. Should that not be an option she will influence the nearby terrain to grow a portal enticing the PCs to her.

## The Realm of the Pumpkin Queen
Once the party enters the portal they find themselves in the Halloween realm of the Pumpkin Queen. 

When the characters walk through the gate at then end of the path, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> As you approach the gate you realize that the other side is nothing but pumpkin patch as far as the eye can see.  It seems to go on forever.  Rolling hills covered in pumpkin vines, straw bales and cornstalks dot the area.  In the distance you can make out the form of a castle.  Only about 50 feet in front of you is what that really catches your eye.  A strangely beautiful and somewhat familiar form sits on a stack of hay bales surrounded by pumpkins of all shapes and sizes.   Some of them have been expertly carved.  Others appear to be total hack jobs.  Some are lit by candles... or perhaps magic.  Other sit dark and unfinished.  A warm fall breeze briefly kicks up bits of straw and fall leaves.  The women looks at you and smiles.  "I've been waiting for this a whole year..."

The Queen is excited to see the PCs again.  If one of them is missing she'll be disappointed and show a pouty face, but will be content that she has lured most of them into her realm.  She'll give them a minute or two to ask questions or try to refamiliarize themselves with her.

Once her patience with the Players wears thin, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The Pumpkin Queen seems to be assessing you as she listens to your questions.  "Last season we played trick or treat and I think you found my trick a little to... easy.  It was SO much fun, though. So.  I'd like to play trick or treat with you again.  What do you say?"

If the party suggests she looks different from last season, read: 
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> "Oh...  I just take whatever form suits me as long as its within the scope of my power"   

If Cassandra is still with the party she will look directly at her and say, "Right, my dear?"

If the players agree to play again this year, the Queen stands up and does a little dance to show off her happiness.  She doesn't give the players any additional time to prepare, however.   Her body transforms into a murder of crows and flies off. Suddenly one of the larger pumpkins throughout the patch starts to move and take on a new form.  Additionally, two large wolves crest a hill and approach the party menacingly.

## Development 
Once combat is done, the warm fall breeze will blow again kicking up leaves and bits of hay back toward the portal through which the PC's entered.

## Features of the Area 
**Illumination:** Sunset. 

**Field:** The field is littered with pumpkins, haybales, piles of hay and corn stalks like a perpetual fall festival.  Particularly dense areas of vines are considered difficult terrain. 

## Concluding the Adventure
When the characters arrive back at the portal, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A small table and three pedestals have appeared, seeming to have grown out of the ground.  The table is filled with sweats of many different types and hot cider.  Sitting, one on each of the pedestals, are jack-o-lanterns.  Their carved faces slowly shift from to show different emotions.  You see the top of each has been carved and can be removed.

The players will be allowed to open only two of the jack-o-lanterns.  When the second is opened the third will explode and shower the party in pumpkin.  Within each are the PC's treat for playing with the Queen.  The faces will give the players a clue about if they are really getting a treat or if they have been tricked yet again.
