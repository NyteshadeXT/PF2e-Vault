# Background
Centuries ago, a powerful goliath sorcerer named Voran Earthmane constructed a keep in the middle of a rank swamp where he could conduct his arcane research in peace. Voran conducted many experiments in the laboratory beneath his keep, mostly centered on the creation of magic items that harnessed the power of the Elemental Chaos. One of his achievements was a staff that drew strength from earth, and he called it the staff of earthen might.

When the great meteorite fell from the heavens and plowed the Chaos Scar, it destroyed Voran’s keep, along with many other features of the terrain. The swamp drained away, leaving only a desolate, dry ruin in its wake. Only the ground floor of the keep and the laboratory beneath it escaped destruction, but even these meager remains were buried in the wake of the meteorite’s fall. Voran himself escaped the obliteration of his home, but with his life’s work in shambles, he collected those of his belongings he could find and departed the area for lands unknown, and his name and legacy faded into history.

A few weeks ago, a tribe of boggards called the Muckrakers, drawn by the evil siren song of the meteorite, uncovered the ruins of Voran Earthmane’s keep and moved in. The boggards’ poisonous and corruptive influence has hastened the ruined keep’s deterioration and damaged Voran’s staff of earthen might. The damaged staff has opened a small portal onto a sea of elemental mud in the Elemental Chaos, allowing a steady tide of the muck to fill the ruins.

Over the past few weeks, the mud has filled much of the laboratory beneath the ruins with a thick layer of sludge; creating a sticky wallow that is ideal for swamp-dwelling boggards. Content with their new home, the boggards have begun to look to the lands beyond the valley. A rich bounty of loot and murder lies just beyond the King’s Wall, and the rapacious boggards will certainly not be able to resist such a temptation for long.

# Running the Adventure

![[Pasted image 20230824115759.png]]

“Stick in the Mud” takes place in the Chaos Scar. You can use one of the hooks below to get the PCs into the valley and into the ruins of Voran Earthmane’s keep. These hooks also come with a minor quest that, if completed, can net the PCs some extra experience.

## Boggard Bounty
The ruins of Voran Earthmane's keep are close enough to the King's Wall that the boggards have been attacking merchants and travelers.  A local baliff, Kendon Longstrider, hires the PCs to find and kill the marauding tribe of boggards, offering a 5 gp bounty on each boggard killed.  A survivor of the boggard attacks can point the PCs in the general direction from which the boggards came.

Read or paraphrase the following when they reach the ruins of Voran Earthmane’s keep:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The barren stretch of valley before you suddenly becomes a chaotic jumble of shattered masonry. In the center of the mess, on a low hill, stands the ruined foundation of a keep or tower. Only the lower section and a few walls still stand; however, enough remains intact to cast ominous shadows that could hide nearly anything.

# Encounter 1 - The Ruins
![[Pasted image 20230824130940.png]]

**Encounter Difficulty:** Moderate (80 xp)
Creatures:
 - 2: [[boggard-scout|Boggard Scout]]

```encounter
name: The Ruins
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 2: [[Boggard Scout]]
```

The PCs enter the ruined ground floor of the ancient keep and must find their way into the remains of the laboratory below. The PCs can enter the ruins through the intact main doors or can attempt to sneak through one of the many gaps in the walls. The boggards in this area are not taking great pains to hide, but the partially intact walls, rubble, and the various mud wallows in the ruins grant them some concealment from intruders.

Lazy, inattentive, and confident, the boggards might not notice the PCs approaching if the heroes exercise some caution and attempt to sneak up to the ruins. However, if the boggards catch sight of the PCs (the PCs can attempt a group [[skills#Stealth|Stealth]] check if they approach together, opposed by the boggard twitchers’ passive [[skills#Perception|Perception]] of 13), they attempt to ambush the heroes. In the latter case, make Stealth checks for each of the boggards and compare them to the PCs’ passive [[skills#Perception|Perception]] checks.

When the PCs enter the ruins, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> A soggy gloom fills the crumbling ruins of this keep. The few intact walls cast thick pools of shadows that obscure the jumbled mess of debris that covers the spongy wooden floor. A wet, boggy stench saturates the interior of the ruins, likely from the thick pits of mud that bubble up from some hidden reservoir below, creating wallows of slimy muck.

When the PCs see the boggards, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Squatting in muddy wallows amid the ruined keep are half a dozen froglike humanoids. Some of them grip crude spears and javelins, while the others are naked save for a coating of filthy mud. A chorus of deep, reverberating croaks echoes off the walls of the ruins when the creatures see you.

## Tactics
The boggards have no goals in this encounter beyond killing the PCs and looting their corpses. In addition, being very chaotic and fairly greedy, they do not even bother to warn the rest of their tribe in the laboratory below the ruins if combat breaks out here.

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** Exposed to the elements, the ruins are brightly lit in most areas. However, the intact walls do cast long shadows that provide areas of dim light.

**Collapsed Walls/Rubble:** These piles of stone and debris are difficult terrain.

**Mud Wallows:** The mud here is roughly knee deep to a Medium creature, and the wallows are considered difficult terrain. The boggards’ swamp walk ability allows them to move through the mud
wallows without hindrance.

**Trapdoor:** Obscured by rubble and debris, this trapdoor opens onto a stairwell leading down into the laboratory beneath the ruins. The trapdoor can be found with a DC 12 Perception check.

# Encounter 2 - The Study
![[Pasted image 20230824131938.png]]

**Encounter Difficulty:** Severe (120 xp)
Creatures:
 - 2: [[boggard-warrior|Boggard Warrior]]

```encounter
name: The Study
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 2: [[Boggard Warrior]]
```

The PCs move down a stone staircase into the first room of the ruined laboratory beneath the ruins. This room once served as a Voran Earthmane’s study, although time and the deleterious presence of the boggards have left little but a mud-choked ruin. The mud in this room can be treacherous, and the shallow pit in the center of the room appears as just more mud-covered stone, making it hard to detect and avoid.

The boggards in this room are not on alert, and are unlikely to be prepared to ambush the PCs. If the PCs move quietly, they might be able to sneak up on the boggards and gain a surprise round. Combat in this room does alert the mud lord in the next room; however, the mud lord doesn’t send any of the giant frogs or croakers that serve it to aid the boggards in the study, preferring instead to set its own ambush for the heroes.

When the PCs enter this room, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> This stone chamber is bathed in a greasy, yellow glow from a pair of smoking braziers in the northwest and southeast corners of the room. The floor is covered in a thick viscous mud that adds a swampy stink to the pungent smoke issuing from the braziers. Toppled tables, bookshelves, and other bits of furniture thrust up from the muck in various places like islands in a muddy sea. Four loathsome, froglike humanoids squat in the mud on the east end of the room, near a pair of double doors that are slightly ajar.

[[skills#Perception|Perception]] DC 15
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> You also notice that the mud in the center of the room seems much deeper and stickier than that in the rest of the chamber.

## Tactics
The boggards here are aware of the hidden quagmire hazard in the center of the room and attempt to use it to their advantage. When one or more PCs becomes immobilized in the quagmire, the boggard dash forward and attack a trapped PC without entering the quagmire themselves. They continue to stab trapped PCs, focusing on those knocked prone by boggard charge.

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** A pair of braziers burning a pungent fungus provides illumination in this room. The braziers provide bright illumination out to 4 squares, with spaces beyond this ranged counting as dim light.

**Ceiling:** The ceiling in this area is 15 feet high.

**Bookshelves/Tables:** A character can jump onto a toppled bookshelf or the table with a DC 20 Athletics check (remember the –2 penalty to Athletic checks imposed by the muddy squares). Anyone under the table has superior cover (–5 penalty to attack rolls against him). A character can flip over the table or topple one of the standing bookshelves with a DC 12 Strength check; both can be tipped over to provide cover.

**Braziers:** If tipped over, each brazier creates a burst 1 zone of greasy smoke that provides total concealment to those within it. The zone lasts until the end of the creature’s turn that tipped over the brazier.

**Muddy Squares:** Although not deep enough to hinder movement, the elemental mud that covers these squares is treacherously slick. Any Acrobatics, Athletics, or Stealth checks made in a muddy square take a –2 penalty. Boggards and any creature with swamp walk do not take the penalty to skill checks.

# Encounter 3 - Chamber of the Frog
![[Pasted image 20230824132807.png]]

**Encounter Difficulty:** Severe (120 xp)
Creatures:
 - 1: [[boggard-scout|Boggard Scout]]
 - 2: [[giant-frog|Giant Frog]]

```encounter
name: Chamber of the Frog
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 1: [[Boggard Scout]]
- 2: [[Giant Frog]]
```

This area was once the main alchemical and magical laboratory of Voran Earthmane. The large L-shaped stone tables and tall book shelves were magically hewn from the surrounding stone, and thus have withstood the march of centuries and the residence of the boggards far better than those in the study. The ruins and shards of old alchemical equipment can be found scattered on the tables and the floor here.

The noise of the combat in area 2 alerts the boggard mud lord and its giant frogs and croaker minions in this room. When the PCs enter the room, the giant frogs are in the mud wallow, while the croakers and the mud lord hide beneath the large stone tables that dominate the center of the room. Make Stealth checks for the croakers and mud lord and compare them with the PCs’ passive Perception checks.

When the PCs enter this room, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> This large room is lit by more of the stinking, smoky braziers and seems to be even muddier than the previous room. A pair of large, L-shaped tables and a number of tall bookshelves, all made of stone and strewn with the broken remains of ancient alchemical equipment, mark this room as having once been some kind of laboratory. The center of the room is taken up by a shallow pit filled with thick mud, and within this filthy wallow are two of the most enormous frogs you have ever seen.

[[skills#Perception|Perception]] DC 10
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> There is a bulky stone door, barred and shut, in the south wall. A steady river of thick mud flows from beneath the door.

## Tactics
The giant frogs attack as soon as the PCs enter the  room. Each frog uses grasping tongue to snare the closest PC and pull him into its maw. Once a giant frog has swallowed a PC, it uses prodigious leap to escape any further combat; however, if cornered, it continues to attack. The boggard waits until the PCs engage the giant frogs before unleashing its own attacks. 

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** A trio of braziers burning a pungent fungus provides illumination in this room. The braziers provide bright illumination out to 4 squares, with spaces beyond this ranged counting as dim light.

**Ceiling:** The ceiling is 15 feet high.

**Bookcases/Shelves:** The large bookcases and shelving units in this room are 10 feet high and have been magically shaped directly from the surrounding stone of the walls. They cannot be toppled over, but they can be climbed with a DC 15 Athletics check.

**Braziers:** If tipped over, each brazier creates a burst 1 zone of greasy smoke that provides total concealment to those within it. The zone lasts until the end of the creature’s turn that tipped over the brazier.

**Vault Door:** The large stone door in the south wall leads to the vault containing the malfunctioning staff of earthen might. It is not locked, but the door is heavy and the thick mud flowing beneath it makes it difficult to open. A DC 15 Strength check is required to push open the vault door.

**Mud Wallow:** The mud here is roughly knee-deep to a Medium creature, and the wallow is considered difficult terrain. The boggards’ and giant frogs’ swamp walk ability allows them to move through the mud wallow without hindrance.

**Muddy Squares:** Although not deep enough to hinder movement, the mud that covers these squares is treacherously slick. Any Acrobatics, Athletics, or Stealth checks made in a muddy square take a –2 penalty. boggards and any creature with swamp walk do not take the penalty to skill checks.

**Tables:** A character can jump onto a table with a DC 20 Athletics check (remember the –2 penalty to Athletic checks imposed by the muddy squares). Anyone behind a table has cover (–2 penalty to attack rolls against him) and anyone beneath the table has superior cover (–5 penalty to attack rolls against him). The tables are solid stone and are bolted to the floor; they cannot be tipped over.

# Encounter 4 - Vault of the Staff
![[Pasted image 20230824133342.png]]

**Encounter Difficulty:** Unknown
Creatures:
 - 1: Mud Man

![[Pasted image 20230824133553.png]]

```encounter
name: Vault of the Staff
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 1: Mud Man
```

The large chamber was once a storage room where Voran kept his creations, including the staff of earthen might. While poking around in here, one of the boggards cracked the staff, opening the rift to the Elemental Chaos. The staff has been spewing mud from the Elemental Chaos for weeks now, and the area around the staff is a swirling mire of churning mud. The boggards avoid this room because it has recently become the lair of four mud men, minor elementals whose malleable body allowed them to squeeze through the tiny portal to the Elemental Chaos opened by the staff of earthen might. The mud men are within the thick mud around the staff, and are, for all intents and purposes, invisible to the PCs until they attack.

In order to retrieve the staff of earthen might, the PCs need to defeat the mud men and complete a skill challenge to close the portal to the Elemental Chaos.
![[Pasted image 20230824133740.png]]

When the PCs enter this room, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> This stone vault is lined with shelves holding many strange devices. Some of them even appear to be intact and might be valuable. However, your most pressing concern lies at the southern end of the room, in a small alcove, where a thick, stone staff juts out from a swirling vortex of mud and spews forth a steady deluge of elemental muck.

When the mud men attack, read:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Suddenly, the roiling mud rises up in vaguely anthropomorphic shapes that flail and batter at you with lashing, muddy appendages.

## Tactics
The mud men do not attack until a PC moves into the thick mud around the staff, at which time they rise up and attack the nearest intruder. When combat begins, two mud men attack any PCs in the thick mud around the staff with slam attacks, while the other two use mud ball to keep the other PCs at bay. After the first round of combat, the mud men focus their melee and ranged attacks on any creature that is slowed or immobilized to take advantage of relentless assault.

The mud men do not use any sophisticated tactics beyond those described above and fight to their destruction to protect their new home.

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** The staff glows with a dull yellow light, providing dim light.

**Ceiling:** The ceiling is 15 feet high.

**Muddy Squares:** Although not deep enough to hinder movement, the elemental mud that covers these squares is treacherously slick. Any Acrobatics, Athletics, or Stealth checks made in a muddy square take a –2 penalty. boggards and any creatures with swamp walk do not take the penalty to skill checks. Shelves: The large shelving units in this room are 10 feet high, have been magically shaped directly from the surrounding stone of the walls, and cannot be toppled over. However, they can be climbed with a DC 15 Athletics check.

**Thick Mud:** The squares around the staff are filled with thick mud and are challenging terrain. A skill check is not required to move into a square with thick mud; however, it requires a DC 10 Athletics check to move out of a square with thick mud; a failed check means the PC is immobilized (save ends).

**Treasure:** If repaired and retrieved, the staff is a staff of earthen might +1.
