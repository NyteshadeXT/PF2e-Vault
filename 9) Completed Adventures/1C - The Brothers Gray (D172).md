# Adventure Hooks

1. A Wives Plea

1. The farmer Lenlevel has been ambushed and taken captives by the Brothers Gray.  His wife, Wara, seeks out the PCs for assistance.  She knows he was on the way to the wall foraging on the northwest side of the wall from the gate.
2. Quest XP: 100 XP for each halfling brother the heroes slay.

1. Murder!

1. The reason the nearby barony sent guards after the brothers is more than just a general interest in preserving the peace. The Brothers Gray ambushed a merchant caravan leaving the barony just a few weeks ago, and killed everyone traveling with the merchant. The merchant was actually a cousin to the baron, and he wants his kinsman’s killers brought to justice. The baron has put a bounty on the heads of the killers, and will reward the PCs via an emissary if they show proof that the deed is done.
2. Quest XP: 100 XP and 50 gp for each halfling brother the heroes slay.
