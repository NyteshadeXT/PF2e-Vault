# Background
Many adventurers come to the Chaos Scar looking for lost treasure, powerful magic, and vicious monsters to defeat. The Scar has all three in copious amounts, and some seek to make a profit by turning a negative (captured creatures such as rust monsters or the last known location of a missing band of would-be heroes) into a positive—for them if nobody else. The beholder gauth named Shur-Tuuz is one such profiteer, and its recent efforts have seen it lead a group of duergar to the tower, where it also hopes to profit by selling a couple of rust monsters to a band of local gnolls. The beholder already has the duergars’ payment for the information; now it seeks to gain payment for the rust monsters. 

After the beholder arrived at the location with the band of duergar, they all discovered that the tower hadn’t had inhabitants for a few months. Seeing another opportunity, Shur-Tuuz sent its runner off to the gnolls, but also sent another back to one of its usual haunts to gather more forces. It wants to keep the tower as another base of operations. Thus far, Shur-Tuuz has succeeded at its endeavors to sell information and various “found” goods, and this tower could serve as a useful location for it. Storing vicious creatures in some of its bases is not convenient; this place, however, is far enough out that it can consider selling more dangerous creatures than rust monsters. 

Unfortunately for Shur-Tuuz, a local druid saw its band heading toward the tower, plus the rust monsters, and she quickly made it known to contacts that something was going on at the tower. How this news reaches the ears of the adventurers is up to the DM (see some hooks below for ideas), but the druid and other folk are not happy with the idea of having a beholder in that tower, and they don’t appreciate the presence of rust monsters in the area. The heroes might also know the former inhabitants of the tower and seek to discover what happened to them. Whatever the case, they arrive as the negotiations for the rust monsters are taking place.

# Adventure Hooks
**Not Rust Monsters!:** The druid [[Lofinor]] who lives in the area of the tower saw the rust monsters being taken to the tower by the beholder. He made this information known to Vatoris who approaches the heroes. He wants to alleviate the concerns the druid has about the rust monsters. Perhaps the druid finished handling a rust monster menace elsewhere and wishes to prevent this from happening again—but the beholder and its duergar entourage are beyond his ability to handle.

**Shur-Tuuz Must Pay:** While staying at the Stumbling Giant for a night Vatoris is targeted by assassins. The heroes tracked down the source of the betrayal to Shur-Tuuz. The beholder has learned of the players efforts to cleanse the Scar and seeks to eliminate them before they become a problem for him. Of course, if Shur-Tuuz were eliminated, the heroes would take one step closer to victory.

**Job Board Posting** [[Lord Drysdale]] offers 1,000 gold for anyone who can eliminate the beholder Shur-Tuuz. The successful party can collect from Lord Drysdale personally. (Vanguard Tower)

# Running the Adventure
## The Tower
Formerly the base for the Cats of Thleen, the tower is being used for different purposes now.

**Top Floor (An Interrupted Negotiation):** Artemeque Labruinn, the leader of the Cats of Thleen, came to the Chaos Scar, realizing its potential as a base of operations. He reserved the top floor for himself as a library, where he would carefully plan the Cats’ next big heist. Over the years, he has collected information about the Scar and those interested in it. Someday, he hopes that selling this collection of lore will allow him to retire. Currently the room is the location where the gnoll and beholder are meeting to make the exchange.

**Middle Floor (Snake Charmers):** Zagira, a catfolk oracle, accompanied Artemeque to the area. The oracle spends most of her time studying the meteor, because she seeks to harness its power. Zagira took over the middle floor of the tower, though she is rarely there. Instead, she wanders the Scar seeking out the strange interaction between the metal and arcane energy. When she first arrived, she turned her floor into a series of interconnected teleportation wards to allow the Cats to teleport to any one of their bases hidden within the forest. Today, several gnolls plus their snake pets are keeping watch on this floor while the negotiations take place on the floor above them.

**Ground Floor (Ambush in the Dark):** The third Cat, Jorg Quillburn, is a dwarf expert of elemental earth magic. Quillburn’s elementals built the tower, and Quillburn chose to take over the base floor of the tower and make it into an art gallery of sorts. He likes to sculpt statues in his spare time, using his mastery of stone to create works of art. His last big score was stealing an artifact from the duergar and hiding it in one of his sculptures. Several duergar, who are here thanks to the beholder’s information, are attempting to locate the item.

## Shur-Tuuz
Shur-Tuuz likes to acquire information, items, and creatures to sell to others, and he has a small customer base built up already. The beholder is an entrepreneur who started successfully building up his own business just over a year ago. He believes that the information in the tower will add to his profits in some manner and intends to start going through the library that the Cats have acquired.

## The Gnolls
The gnolls are recent clients of Shur-Tuuz.

# Getting Started
Read or paraphrase the following when the adventurers reach the base of Vanguard Tower:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The rectangular tower juts out of the ground, combining natural and structured features in unusual ways. Its sides are like craggy rock faces rather than smooth chiseled stone. Windows in the sides of the structure look like natural alcoves, yet the sun glints off glass set within each alcove. Two large doors at the base of the tower open into darkness, and the sounds of pick and shovel on stone echo within the structure.

The tower is 50 feet tall, and the other floors can be accessed through windows (DC 15 [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]] check to reach each window). Coming in through the windows will change the order of the encounters but have no effect on the encounters themselves. In fact, if the heroes think to peer into the windows, feel free to give them a preview of the monsters inside the tower.

# Encounter 1 - Ground Floor: Ambush in the Dark
**Encounter Difficulty:** Low (60 xp)

Creatures:

 - 3: [[duergar-miner|Duergar Miner]] M
 - 2: [[duergar-scout|Duergar Scout]] S

```encounter
name: Ambush in the Dark
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 2: [[Duergar Shocktrooper]] 
- 3: [[Duergar Miner]]
- 2: [[Duergar Scout]]
```

The duergar are chipping away at the corrupted stones that make up the tower. The Cats of Thleen took something from them before they went missing, and the duergar are tearing the room apart to bring it back home. Anyone pausing to listen to them talk in Deep Speech can hear that they’re searching for an item of importance to them.

Read the following when the heroes enter the room, either through the main doors or through one of the windows around the tower:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The base of the tower is a mess. What was once a welcoming area is now little more than a junk room. Smashed statues litter the floor. Beautiful tapestries lie tattered on the ground or have been used to tie off rough mining equipment.
> 
> The guttural chatter drops off suddenly. The sound of work comes to a stop, replaced by a slow rhythmic thumping. Duergar mash their tools on the ground, creating a deafening beat in the room. 
> 
> Suddenly, the windows seal close and the doors slam shut. The only thing you hear is the angry pounding. The only thing you see in the darkness is the glow of seven pairs of eyes.

## Tactics
The duergars’ limited knowledge of elemental magic allows them to control this room of the tower and turn it to their advantage. By shutting the doors and sealing the windows, the room is entirely enclosed in darkness and swings the encounter space into favoring the duergar.

The guards engage the heroes as close to their entry point as possible. They try to keep the scouts free to rain down ranged attacks on their opponents. If the miners have been eliminated, the guards concentrate their attacks on any heroes bearing a light source, but they do not break off to close the doors if they are open.

If the adventurers draw their own illumination devices, such as torches, the miners attack the individuals bearing a light source. If a light source is dropped on the floor, one of the duergar miners moves to pick up the item and bury it in one of the rock piles with a minor action. If the miner places it in the rock pile, the light source is considered extinguished.

The duergar scouts do their best to stay to the shadows and attack. They engage the heroes at range and try to keep the long hallways between themselves and the heroes. They target any heroes with ranged abilities first, then heroes with light sources.

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** None. The heroes can force the doors open to allow some light in the room. Breaking open the doors requires a DC 20 [[skills#athletics|Athletics]] check. If the doors are opened, the only squares still bathed in darkness are the ones behind the stairs leading up to the next level.

**Rock Piles:** The piles of rocks are considered difficult terrain.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> With a DC 30 [[skills#Perception|Perception]] check the players find, hidden under a pile of rocks: 9 gp, 81 cp and a [[tracking-fulu-som|Tracking Fulu]]

# Encounter 2 - Middle Floor: Snake Charmers
**Encounter Difficulty:** Moderate (100 xp)

![[4C - Vanguard Tower (D182)-20240104124405614.webp|right]]

Creatures:
 - 1: [[gnoll-warfang|Gnoll Warfang]] W
 - 2: [[gnoll-deathpledged|Gnoll Deathpledged]] G
 - 5: [[emperor-cobra|Emperor Cobra]] C

```encounter
name: Ambush in the Dark
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 1: [[Gnoll Warfang]] 
- 2: [[Gnoll Deathpledged]]
- 5: [[Emperor Cobra]]
```

The gnolls brought the cobras with them and watch them move in the hallway. The deathpledged do not move—they are ready to die for their leader at a moment’s notice. The five spitting cobras wait in the hall: two on either side of the stairs and one directly in front. Before the encounter, one snake attempts to sneak past the heroes by making a DC 14 Stealth check. A failed check triggers the encounter.

Read the following when the heroes enter the room, either up the stairs or through one of the windows around the tower, or when a snake fails a Stealth check:
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Numerous hisses echo though the halls of this level of the tower. A quick glance downward shows several large snakes writhing on the floor. They crawl over broken stone, cracked glass, and other broken belongings of those who once lived here.

## Tactics
The spitting cobras attack at anyone coming up the stairs and then withdraw down the hallway as the gnolls advance. They try to hit as many different targets as they can before they are killed.

The deathpledged attack whichever hallway has fewer minions after the first round. They target any controllers first if any cobras are left.

The gnoll warfang accompanies the deathpledged gnolls, but as soon as one of the gnolls drops, it can no longer use its pack attack ability and should consider using the central wall teleport to single out any lone hero.

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** Sunrods placed along the western and eastern walls illuminate the hall.

**Central Wall:** The central wall is covered in strange markings. The gnoll warfang has painted similar markings on its chest. Once an encounter, it can touch the central wall and teleport to any square adjacent to it. A hero can attempt the same thing by painting sigils on a person with a DC 16 [[skills#Arcana|Arcana]] check as one action. Each hero can teleport once during the encounter as one action.

> [!tip]+ Treasure
> The gnoll warfang is carrying a pouch containing a [[truth-potion|Truth Potion]] 10 gp and 8 cp.

# Encounter 3 - Upper Floor: An Interrupted Negotiation
**Encounter Difficulty:** Severe (140 xp)

![[4C - Vanguard Tower (D182)-20240104143040603.webp|right]]

Creatures:
 - 1: [[imentesh|Sur-Tuuz]] B
 - 1: [[gnoll-warfang|Gnoll Warfang]] G
 - 2: [[Behir]] R

```encounter
name: An Interrupted Negotiation
party: Chaos Scar
creatures:
- 1: [[Gnoll Warfang]] 
- 1: [[Imentesh, Sur-Tuuz]]
- 2: [[Behir]]
```


The Imentesh is seated next to small table in the lower left hand corner. The magic item from the treasure parcel is located on the table. The gnoll plans to pay Shur-Tuuz with it in exchange for one of the behir Shur-Tuuz has in its possession. The Imentesh and gnoll are speaking in a mix of Abyssal and Deep Speech. A character would need to understand both languages to follow their conversation. 

Read the following when the heroes enter the room, either up the stairs or through one of the windows around the tower:

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Bookshelves line one wall of the area, and an alchemy set occupies a table near the stairs. Two behir are curled up around the table. A glowing blue cage of bone surrounds them.
> 
> You hear the sounds of speech coming from the end of the long bookshelves, but the voices are too hushed to make out the language. Seated at a small table near the shelves are two creatures. One is recognizable as a human it's eyes consistently scanning the surroundings. The other is a gnoll with its hand on an item on the table.

If the heroes make their presence known, read the following, adjusting as needed to fit the circumstances:

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> As you approach, the human walks away from the table and turns its attentions to you. “Perhaps a bit of a break before we continue? I’m sure you’d like a demonstration.” The human barks a word and the bone cage clatters to the floor.

## Tactics
Shur-Tuuz fights the first part of the battle to show off to its potential client. It changes into it's true form and then attempts to use Warpweave on the target it believes to be the greatest threat. Once it is bloodied, it starts playing for keeps.

The warfang stays out of the fight initially unless attacked. If Shur-Tuuz takes double digit damage from any attack, it convinces the warfang to aid it by giving the gnolls the behir for free.

## Features of the Area
**Illumination:** The fireplace offers the primary source of illumination, though [[Sunrod]] in sconces along the wall also provide light around the edges of the room.

**Bookshelves:** The bookshelves contain journals from various adventurers.  Found here are Spell scroll (3rd level) ([[rouse-skeletons-som|Rouse Skeletons]]), Spell scroll (3rd level) ([[reincarnate-apg|Reincarnate]]),  Spell scroll (4th level) ([[Zephyr Slip]]), Spell scroll (5th level) ([[wyvern-sting-aoe4|Wyvern Sting]]), Spell scroll (5th level) ([[dancing-blade-da|Dancing Blade]]),  Spell scroll (5th level) ([[plant-form|Plant Form]]) and a book titled Earthsong.  Earthsong is a treatise on environmental management and contains insights for the following spells: [[tame-som|Tame]], [[fleet-step|Fleet Step]], [[distortion-lens-da|Distortion Lens]], [[summon-lesser-servitor-som|Summon Lesser Servitor]], [[invisible-item-apg|Invisible Item]] , [[animal-form|Animal Form]], [[water-walk|Water Walk]], [[positive-attunement-som|Positive Attunement]], [[elemental-annihilation-wave-som|Elemental Annihilation Wave]] and [[insect-form|Insect Form]].

**Alchemist’s Table:** Adventurers can find a [[leapers-elixir|Leaper's Elixir (Greater)]] amongst all the alchemy tools and debris.

**Blue Sigils:** In addition, the blue sigils represent wards containing the behir. Shur-Tuuz drops the wards at the beginning of the encounter but they can be brought back. Restoring the wards requires a DC 18 [[skills#Arcana|Arcana]] or [[skills#Nature|Nature]] check as a standard action. The beholder automatically succeeds in restoring the wards with a single action

> [!example]+ Magic Item
> In addition to all of the above, found on the table are the following: [[staff-of-healing|Staff of Healing (Greater)]], [[beastmasters-sigil-tv|Beastmaster's Sigil (Major)]], [[assassin-vine-wine-tv|Assassin Vine Wine]], 200 gp.

# Conclusion
The heroes might wish to use the tower as a base of operations for their further adventures in the Chaos Scar. The characters can shore up the physical defenses easily and use it as a place to store their treasure. The adventurers might also wish to seek out the history of those who lived in the tower before them and complete any unfinished business. The fate of the Cats of Thleen is left open. Perhaps they were killed, or perhaps they retreated to another hideout with grander treasures hidden away.

On the other hand, the heroes might believe the tower has been corrupted too thoroughly. Destroying the tower can be as simple as a ritual discovered in the library or as involved as putting the ghost of Jorg Quillburn or another Cat of Thleen to rest.

If the journals survived the encounter on the top floor, they are an excellent source of maps, cryptic entries, and encoded pages leading to other adventures in the Scar or wherever the heroes turn their attention next.
